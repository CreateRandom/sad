FAIR TRADE!
Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!
Very good meetings with North Korea.
Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia! The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative but they know it is not true!
The corrupt Mainstream Media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people Spies (Informants) into my campaign! Surveillance much?
Iger where is my call of apology? You and ABC have offended millions of people and they demand a response. How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie yet no apology. Double Standard!
RUSH LIMBAUGH  ‚ÄúIf the FBI was so concerned and if they weren‚Äôt targeting Trump they should have told Trump. If they were really concerned about the Russians infiltrating a campaign (hoax) then why not try to stop it? Why not tell Trump? Because they were pushing this scam.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe recusal of Jeff Sessions was an unforced betrayal of the President of the United States.‚Äù JOE DIGENOVA former U.S. Attorney.
The soon to be released book ‚ÄúThe Russia Hoax The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton And Frame Donald Trump‚Äù written by Gregg Jarrett looks like a real deal big hit. The Phony Witch Hunt will be opened up for the world to see! Out in 5 weeks.
Very importantly USERNAME will win for the Republicans in November...and his opponent will not. Remember Alabama. We can‚Äôt take any chances on losing to a Nancy Pelosi controlled Democrat!
There is no one better to represent the people of N.Y. and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than USERNAME who is strong on Borders & Crime loves our Military & our Vets voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again. Dan has my full endorsement!
Great meeting with USERNAME today talked about prison reform and sentencing. HYPERLINK
Moments ago it was my great honor to sign #RightToTry into law! HYPERLINK HYPERLINK
With the #RightToTry Law I signed today patients with life threatening illnesses will finally have access to experimental treatments that could improve or even cure their conditions. These are experimental treatments and products that have shown great promise... HYPERLINK
Today I am proud to keep another promise to the American people as I sign the #RightToTry Legislation into law. HYPERLINK
Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that ‚ÄúABC does not tolerate comments like those‚Äù made by Roseanne Barr. Gee he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn‚Äôt get the call?
The Failing and Corrupt USERNAME estimated the crowd last night at ‚Äú1000 people‚Äù when in fact it was many times that number - and the arena was rockin‚Äô. This is the way they demean and disparage. They are very dishonest people who don‚Äôt ‚Äúget‚Äù me and never did!
....There are lots of really good lawyers in the country he could have picked somebody else!‚Äù And I wish I did!
....chief law enforcement officer and they told me later ‚Äòoh by the way I‚Äôm not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office I would be frustrated too...and that‚Äôs how I read that - Senator Sessions why didn‚Äôt you tell me before I picked you.....
Rep.Trey Gowdy ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so I think what the President is doing is expressing frustration that Attorney General Sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job not afterward. If I were the President and I picked someone to be the country‚Äôs....
The Fake Mainstream Media has from the time I announced I was running for President run the most highly sophisticated & dishonest Disinformation Campaign in the history of politics. No matter how well WE do they find fault. But the forgotten men & women WON I‚Äôm President!
Sorry I‚Äôve got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear bad Trade Deals VA Choice the Economy rebuilding the Military and so much more and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc.
Why aren‚Äôt the 13 Angry and heavily conflicted Democrats investigating the totally Crooked Campaign of totally Crooked Hillary Clinton. It‚Äôs a Rigged Witch Hunt that‚Äôs why! Ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration!
The 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections especially now that Republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in Polls. There was no Collusion except by the Democrats!
‚ÄúThis investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about. It wasn‚Äôt just a wiretap against a campaign aide...it was secretly gathering information on the Trump Campaign...people call that Spying...this is unprecedented and  scandalous.‚Äù Mollie Hemingway
We have put a great team together for our talks with North Korea. Meetings are currently taking place concerning Summit and more. Kim Young Chol the Vice Chairman of North Korea heading now to New York. Solid response to my letter thank you!
Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama‚Äôs term showing children from the Border in steel cages. They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad but backfires. Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of country...Bipartisan Bill!
California has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime high tax problems - along with so many others. On June 5th. vote for GOP Gubernatorial Candidate JOHN COX a really good and highly competent man. He‚Äôll Make California Great Again!
A Democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to Repeal the GOP Tax Cuts (no chance). This is too good to be true for Republicans...Remember the Nancy Pelosi Dems are also weak on Crime the Border and want to be gentle and kind to MS-13 gang members...not good!
Our fallen heroes have not only written our history they have shaped our destiny. They saved the lives of the men and women with whom they served. They cared for their families more than anything in the world they loved their families. They inspired their communities... HYPERLINK
The heroes who rest in these hallowed fields in cemeteries battlefields and burial grounds near and far are drawn the full tapestry of American life. They came from every generation from towering cities and wind swept prairies from privilege and from poverty... HYPERLINK
Thank you for joining us on this solemn day of remembrance. We are gathered here on the sacred soil of USERNAME Cemetery to honor the lives and deeds of America's greatest heroes the men and women who laid down their lives for our freedom. #MemorialDay HYPERLINK
‚ÄúWe now find out that the Obama Administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate or his campaign under investigation. That raises legitimate questions. I just find this really odd...this goes to the heart of our electoral system.‚Äù Jonathan Turley on USERNAME
‚ÄúSally Yates is part of concerns people have raised about bias in the Justice Dept. I find her actions to be really quite unbelievable.‚Äù Jonathan Turley
‚ÄúThe President deserves some answers.‚Äù USERNAME in discussing ‚ÄúSPYGATE.‚Äù
Happy Memorial Day! Those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today. Best economy in decades lowest unemployment numbers for Blacks and Hispanics EVER (& women in 18years) rebuilding our Military and so much more. Nice!

Why didn‚Äôt President Obama do something about the so-called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election? Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn‚Äôt want to upset the apple cart! He was in charge not me and did nothing.
Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself. I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day. Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this. It will happen!
Why didn‚Äôt the 13 Angry Democrats investigate the campaign of Crooked Hillary Clinton many crimes much Collusion with Russia? Why didn‚Äôt the FBI take the Server from the DNC?  Rigged Investigation!
Fantastic to have 400000 GREAT MEN & WOMEN of Rolling Thunder in D.C. showing their patriotism. They love our Country they love our Flag they stand for our National Anthem! Thanks to Executive Director Artie Muller.
Who‚Äôs going to give back the young and beautiful lives (and others) that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony Russia Collusion Witch Hunt? They journeyed down to Washington D.C. with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation...They went back home in tatters!
WELCOME HOME JOSH! HYPERLINK
When will the 13 Angry Democrats (& those who worked for President O) reveal their disqualifying Conflicts of Interest? It‚Äôs been a long time now! Will they be indelibly written into the Report along with the fact that the only Collusion is with the Dems Justice FBI & Russia?
This whole Russia Probe is Rigged. Just an excuse as to why the Dems and Crooked Hillary lost the Election and States that haven‚Äôt been lost in decades. 13 Angry Democrats and all Dems if you include the people who worked for Obama for 8 years. #SPYGATE & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST!
With Spies or ‚ÄúInformants‚Äù as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it‚Äôs not) all over my campaign even from a very early date why didn‚Äôt the crooked highest levels of the FBI or ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù contact me to tell me of the  phony Russia problem?
The Failing USERNAME quotes ‚Äúa senior White House official‚Äù who doesn‚Äôt exist as saying ‚Äúeven if the meeting were reinstated holding it on June 12 would be impossible given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed.‚Äù WRONG AGAIN! Use real people not phony sources.
Unlike what the Failing and Corrupt New York Times would like people to believe there is ZERO disagreement within the Trump Administration as to  how to deal with North Korea...and if there was it wouldn‚Äôt matter. The USERNAME has called me wrong right from the beginning!
Thanks to very brave Teacher & Hero Jason Seaman of Noblesville Indiana for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives. His quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world!
Looking forward to seeing Joshua Holt this evening in the White House. The great people of Utah are Celebrating!
Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. Catch and Release Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL! DEMOCRATS ARE PROTECTING MS-13 THUGS.
Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela. Should be landing in D.C. this evening and be in the White House with his family at about 7:00 P.M. The great people of Utah will be very happy!
We are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit which if it does happen will likely remain in Singapore on the same date June 12th. and if necessary will be extended beyond that date.
...but complain and obstruct. They made only bad deals (Iran) and their so-called Trade Deals are the laughing stock of the world!
Senator Schumer and Obama Administration let phone company ZTE flourish with no security checks. I closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees change of management and board must purchase U.S. parts and pay a $1.3 Billion fine. Dems do nothing....
Funny to watch the Democrats criticize Trade Deals being negotiated by me when they don‚Äôt even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the Obama Administration did NOTHING on trade except let other countries rip off the United States. Lost almost $800 Billion/year under ‚ÄúO‚Äù
Chicago Police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won‚Äôt let them do their job. The killings are at a record pace and tough police work which Chicago will not allow would bring things back to order fast...the killings must stop!
To the USERNAME Class of 2018 I say: We know you are up to the task. We know you will make us proud. We know that glory will be yours. Because you are WINNERS you are WARRIORS you are FIGHTERS you are CHAMPIONS and YOU will lead us to VICTORY! God Bless the U.S.A.! HYPERLINK
On behalf of the American People CONGRATULATIONS! We love you! HYPERLINK
Today it was my great honor to deliver the 2018 Commencement Address at the United States USERNAME in Annapolis Maryland. Congratulations!Good luck. Godspeed. And ANCHORS AWEIGH! HYPERLINK
Very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea. We will soon see where it will lead hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace. Only time (and talent) will tell!
Democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea. Just like they are coming to the defense of MS 13 thugs saying that they are individuals & must be nurtured or asking to end your big Tax Cuts & raise your taxes instead. Dems have lost touch!
‚ÄúEveryone knows there was a Spy and in fact the people who were involved in the Spying are admitting that there was a Spy...Widespread Spying involving multiple people.‚Äù Mollie Hemingway The Federalist Senior Editor  But the corrupt Mainstream Media hates this monster story!
Can anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign by the people and party in absolute power for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? And to think that the party in question even with the expenditure of far more money LOST!
The Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party‚Äôs campaign is different than having a Spy as illegal as that may be. But what about an ‚ÄúInformant‚Äù who is paid a fortune and who ‚Äúsets up‚Äù way earlier than the Russian Hoax?
I will be making the Commencment Address today at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis Maryland. Look forward to being with some of the greatest people on earth!

Not surprisingly the GREAT Men & Women of the FBI are starting to speak out against Comey McCabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the FBI. Comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the FBI! #SPYGATE
Clapper has now admitted that there was Spying in my campaign. Large dollars were paid to the Spy far beyond normal. Starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in U.S. history. SPYGATE - a terrible thing!

Great to be in New York for the day. Heading back to the USERNAME now lots of work to be done! HYPERLINK
Thank you to all of the incredible law enforcement officers and firefighters in Bethpage New York. Keep up the great work! HYPERLINK
Crippling loopholes in our laws have enabled MS-13 gang members and other criminals to infiltrate our communities - and Democrats in Congress REFUSE to close these loopholes including the disgraceful practice known as Catch-and-Release. Democrats must abandon their resistance... HYPERLINK

WITCH HUNT!
There will be big news coming soon for our great American Autoworkers. After many decades of losing your jobs to other countries you have waited long enough!
Big legislation will be signed by me shortly. After many years RIGHT TO TRY and big changes to DODD FRANK.
Our Trade Deal with China is moving along nicely but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion.
‚ÄúTrump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign‚Äù No James Clapper I am not happy. Spying on a campaign would be illegal and a scandal to boot!
Everybody is with Tomi Lahren a truly outstanding and respected young woman! USERNAME
SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear that they had eyes and ears all over the Trump Campaign‚Äù Judge Andrew Napolitano
Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State. They go after Phony Collusion with Russia a made up Scam and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! What goes around comes around!
USERNAME  ‚ÄúNew Bombshell in the Obama Spying Scandal. Did other Agencies SPY on Trump Campaign?‚Äù Even Clapper worlds dumbest former Intelligence Head who has the problem of lying a lot used the word SPY when describing the illegal activities!
If the person placed very early into my campaign wasn‚Äôt a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal...
...Follow the money! The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia because there was no Collusion. He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win - just like they did to Bernie Sanders who got duped!
For the first time since Roe v. Wade America has a Pro-Life President a Pro-Life Vice President a Pro-Life House of Representatives and 25 Pro-Life Republican State Capitals! HYPERLINK

China must continue to be strong & tight on the Border of North Korea until a deal is made. The word is that recently the Border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in. I want this to happen and North Korea to be VERY successful but only after signing!
On China Barriers and Tariffs to come down for first time.
China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products - would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years!
I ask Senator Chuck Schumer why didn‚Äôt President Obama & the Democrats do something about Trade with China including Theft of Intellectual Property etc.? They did NOTHING! With that being said Chuck & I have long agreed on this issue! Fair Trade plus with China will happen!
I hereby demand and will do so officially tomorrow that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!
The Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia - so now they‚Äôre looking at the rest of the World. Oh‚Äô great!
....and why hasn‚Äôt the Podesta brother been charged and arrested like others after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm? Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington D.C.?
What ever happened to the Server at the center of so much Corruption that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of Democrats) FBI? They broke into homes & offices early in the morning but were afraid to take the Server?
Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World they should easily be able to take it into the Mid-Term Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party. Don‚Äôt worry about Dems FISA Abuse missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier!
...in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted 33000 Emails got $145000000 while Secretary of State paid McCabes wife $700000 (and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M) and so much more. Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam.
....At what point does this soon to be $20000000 Witch Hunt composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years STOP! They have found no Collussion with Russia No Obstruction but they aren‚Äôt looking at the corruption...
Things are really getting ridiculous. The Failing and Crooked (but not as Crooked as Hillary Clinton) USERNAME has done a long & boring story indicating that the World‚Äôs most expensive Witch Hunt has found nothing on Russia & me so now they are looking at the rest of the World!
If the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign that is a really big deal. Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee (also Senate Judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers. Drain the Swamp!
Great to have our incredible First Lady back home in the White House. Melania is feeling and doing really well. Thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!

California finally deserves a great Governor one who understands borders crime and lowering taxes. John Cox is the man - he‚Äôll be the best Governor you‚Äôve ever had. I fully endorse John Cox for Governor and look forward to working with him to Make California Great Again!
Just met with UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres who is working hard to ‚ÄúMake the United Nations Great Again.‚Äù When the UN does more to solve conflicts around the world it means the U.S. has less to do and we save money. USERNAME is doing a fantastic job! HYPERLINK

School shooting in Texas. Early reports not looking good. God bless all!
Reports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted for political purposes into my campaign for president. It took place very early on and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a ‚Äúhot‚Äù Fake News story. If true - all time biggest political scandal!
Why isn‚Äôt disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe being investigated for the $700000 Crooked Hillary Democrats in Virginia led by Clinton best friend Terry M (under FBI investigation that they killed) gave to McCabe‚Äôs wife in her run for office? Then dropped case on Clinton!
Fake News Media had me calling Immigrants or Illegal Immigrants ‚ÄúAnimals.‚Äù Wrong! They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories. I referred to MS 13 Gang Members as ‚ÄúAnimals‚Äù a big difference - and so true. Fake News got it purposely wrong as usual!
‚ÄúApparently the DOJ put a Spy in the Trump Campaign. This has never been done before and by any means necessary they are out to frame Donald Trump for crimes he didn‚Äôt commit.‚Äù  David Asman  USERNAME USERNAME   Really bad stuff!

Remember how badly Iran was behaving with the Iran Deal in place. They were trying to take over the Middle East by whatever means necessary. Now that will not happen!
China and the United States are working well together on trade but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China for so many years that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries. But be cool it will all work out!
President Xi of China and I are working together to give massive Chinese phone company ZTE a way to get back into business fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!

Candace Owens of Turning Point USA is having a big impact on politics in our Country. She represents an ever expanding group of very smart ‚Äúthinkers‚Äù and it is wonderful to watch and hear the dialogue going on...so good for our Country!
The Fake News is working overtime. Just reported that despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy & all things else 91% of the Network News about me is negative (Fake). Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? Take away credentials?
The Republican Party had a great night. Tremendous voter energy and excitement and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in November. The Economy is sooo strong and with Nancy Pelosi wanting to end the big Tax Cuts and Raise Taxes why wouldn‚Äôt we win?
The Iran Deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing we know what will happen. In just a short time the world‚Äôs leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world‚Äôs most dangerous weapons.... HYPERLINK
Statement on the Iran Nuclear Deal: HYPERLINK
John Kerry can‚Äôt get over the fact that he had his chance and blew it! Stay away from negotiations John you are hurting your country!
I will be speaking to my friend President Xi of China this morning at 8:30. The primary topics will be Trade where good things will happen and North Korea where relationships and trust are building.
Gina Haspel my highly respected nominee to lead the CIA is being praised for the fact that she has been and alway will be TOUGH ON TERROR! This is a woman who has been a leader wherever she has gone. The CIA wants her to lead them into America‚Äôs  bright and glorious future!
I will be announcing my decision on the Iran Deal tomorrow from the White House at 2:00pm.
National Prescription Drug #TakeBackDay numbers are in! Another record broken: nearly 1 MILLION pounds of Rx pills disposed! Let‚Äôs keep fighting this opioid epidemic America!
The United States does not need John Kerry‚Äôs possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal.  He was the one that created this MESS in the first place!
Is this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections which is what the Democrats always intended? Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!
Lisa Page who may hold the record for the most Emails in the shortest period of time (to her Lover Peter S) and attorney Baker are out at the FBI as part of the Probers getting caught? Why is Peter S still there? What a total mess. Our Country has to get back to Business!
Good luck to Ric Grenell our new Ambassador to Germany. A great and talented guy he will represent our Country well!
‚ÄúThe Great Revolt‚Äù by Salena Zito and Brad Todd does much to tell the story of our great Election victory. The Forgotten Men & Women are forgotten no longer!
The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait ‚Äòtill the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest!
The Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility. House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion Coordination or anything else with Russia. So now the Probe says OK what else is there? How about Obstruction for a made up phony crime.There is no O it‚Äôs called Fighting Back
My highly respected nominee for CIA Director Gina Haspel has come under fire because she was too tough on Terrorists. Think of that in these very dangerous times we have the most qualified person a woman who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror. Win Gina!
To the great people of West Virginia we have together a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is Don Blankenship currently running for Senate can‚Äôt win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!
Thank you Cleveland Ohio! HYPERLINK
Our high level delegation is on the way back from China where they had long meetings with Chinese leaders and business representatives. We will be meeting tomorrow to determine the results but it is hard for China in that they have become very spoiled with U.S. trade wins!

I want to thank all of our friends and patriots at the USERNAME. We will never fail and we will always protect your Second Amendment! God Bless you and God Bless America! HYPERLINK
We are going to demand Congress secure the border in the upcoming CR. Illegal immigration must end!
Democrats and liberals in Congress want to disarm law-abiding Americans at the same time they are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets. Politicians who put criminal aliens before American Citizens should be voted out of office!
All of us here today are united by the same timeless values. We believe that our liberty is a gift from our creator and that no Government can ever take it away. We believe in the rule of law - and we support the men and women of law enforcement. We have pride in our history... HYPERLINK
JUST OUT: 3.9% Unemployment. 4% is Broken! In the meantime WITCH HUNT!
Going to Dallas (the GREAT State of Texas) today. Leaving soon!
NBC NEWS is wrong again! They cite ‚Äúsources‚Äù which are constantly wrong. Problem is like so many others the sources probably don‚Äôt exist they are fabricated fiction! NBC my former home with the Apprentice is now as bad as Fake News CNN. Sad!
Andy McCarthy will be on  USERNAME tonight. 7:00 P.M.  USERNAME.
Because Jobs in the U.S. are doing so well Americans receiving unemployment aid is the lowest since 1973. Great!
Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall. Mexico which has a massive crime problem is doing little to help!

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt some game. You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States.‚Äù  John Dowd March 2018.  With North Korea China the Middle East and so much more there is not much time to be thinking about this especially since there was no Russian ‚ÄúCollusion.‚Äù

A Rigged System - They don‚Äôt want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal ‚Äújustice?‚Äù At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!
NEW BOOK - A MUST READ! ‚ÄúThe Russia Hoax - The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump‚Äù by the brilliant Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett. A sad chapter for law enforcement. A rigged system!
‚ÄúThe questions are an intrusion into the President‚Äôs Article 2  powers under the Constitution to fire any Executive Branch Employee...what the President was thinking is an outrageous.....as to the President‚Äôs unfettered power to fire anyone...‚Äù Joe Digenova former US Attorney
There was no Collusion (it is a Hoax) and there is no Obstruction of Justice (that is a setup & trap). What there is is Negotiations going on with North Korea over Nuclear War Negotiations going on with China over Trade Deficits Negotiations on NAFTA and much more. Witch Hunt!
Today it was my great honor to thank and welcome heroic crew members and passengers of Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 at the USERNAME! HYPERLINK

It would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened! Witch Hunt!
Delegation heading to China to begin talks on the Massive Trade Deficit that has been created with our Country. Very much like North Korea this should have been fixed years ago not now. Same with other countries and NAFTA...but it will all get done. Great Potential for USA!
So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were ‚Äúleaked‚Äù to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh I see...you have a made up phony crime Collusion that never existed and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice!
The White House is running very smoothly despite phony Witch Hunts etc. There is great Energy and unending Stamina both necessary to get things done. We are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so! Fake News is going ‚Äúbonkers!‚Äù
The Fake News is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who don‚Äôt exist). They are totally unhinged and the great success of this Administration is making them do and say things that even they can‚Äôt believe they are saying. Truly bad people!
During Small Business Week we celebrate the great hard-working entrepreneurs across our country who have started and operate a small business!
The migrant ‚Äòcaravan‚Äô that is openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective U.S. immigration laws are. Yet Democrats like Jon Tester continue to support the open borders agenda ‚Äì Tester even voted to protect Sanctuary Cities. We need lawmakers who will put America First.
I recently had a terrific meeting with a bipartisan group of freshman lawmakers who feel very strongly in favor of Congressional term limits. I gave them my full support and endorsement for their efforts. #DrainTheSwamp
Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING but would Peace House/Freedom House on the Border of North & South Korea be a more Representative Important and Lasting site than a third party country? Just asking!
The White House Correspondents‚Äô Dinner is DEAD as we know it. This was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great Country and all that it stands for. FAKE NEWS is alive and well and beautifully represented on Saturday night!
Headline: ‚ÄúKim Prepared to Cede Nuclear Weapons if U.S. Pledges Not to Invade‚Äù - from the Failing New York Times. Also will shut down Nuclear Test Site in May.
The White House Correspondents‚Äô Dinner was a failure last year but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it. The filthy ‚Äúcomedian‚Äù totally bombed (couldn‚Äôt even deliver her lines-much like the Seth Meyers weak performance). Put Dinner to rest or start over!

Secret Service has just informed me that Senator Jon Tester‚Äôs statements on Admiral Jackson are not true. There were no such findings. A horrible thing that we in D.C. must live with just like phony Russian Collusion. Tester should lose race in Montana. Very dishonest and sick!
Look forward to being in the Great State of Michigan tonight. Major business expansion and jobs pouring into your State. Auto companies expanding at record pace. Big crowd tonight will be live on T.V.
Just had a long and very good talk with President Moon of South Korea. Things are going very well time and location of meeting with North Korea is being set. Also spoke to Prime Minister Abe of Japan to inform him of the ongoing negotiations.
‚ÄúClapper lied about (fraudulent) Dossier leaks to CNN‚Äù USERNAME FoxNews  He is a lying machine who now works for Fake News CNN.
....great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being. Admiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would most respect and admire and now for no reason whatsoever his reputation has been shattered. Not fair Tester!
Allegations made by Senator Jon Tester against Admiral/Doctor Ron Jackson are proving false. The Secret Service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony Democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful Jackson family. Tester should resign. The.....
House Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia. As I have been saying all along it is all a big Hoax by the Democrats based on payments and lies. There should never have been a Special Counsel appointed. Witch Hunt!

Kanye West has performed a great service to the Black Community - Big things are happening and eyes are being opened for the first time in Decades - Legacy Stuff! Thank you also to Chance and Dr. Darrell Scott they really get it (lowest Black & Hispanic unemployment in history).
Please do not forget the great help that my good friend President Xi of China has given to the United States particularly at the Border of North Korea. Without him it would have been a much longer tougher process!
So great to have Staff Sgt. Dan Nevins and the incredible WOUNDED WARRIORS with me in the White House yesterday. These are truly brave and special people! USERNAME
KOREAN WAR TO END! The United States and all of its GREAT people should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea!
After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening but only time will tell!
Is everybody believing what is going on. James Comey can‚Äôt define what a leak is. He illegally leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION but doesn‚Äôt understand what he did or how serious it is. He lied all over the place to cover it up. He‚Äôs either very sick or very dumb. Remember sailor!
The U.S. has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada & Mexico for the 2026 World Cup. It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S. bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they don‚Äôt support us (including at the United Nations)?
Loved being on USERNAME this morning. Great show!
I will be interviewed on USERNAME at 8:00 A.M. Enjoy!

Here‚Äôs a great stat - since January 2017 the number of people forced to use food stamps is down 1.9 million. The American people are finally back to work!
Mexico whose laws on immigration are very tough must stop people from going through Mexico and into the U.S. We may make this a condition of the new NAFTA Agreement. Our Country cannot accept what is happening! Also we must get Wall funding fast.
Despite the Democrat inspired laws on Sanctuary Cities and the Border being so bad and one sided I have instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security not to let these large Caravans of people into our Country. It is a disgrace. We are the only Country in the World so naive! WALL
Hard to believe Obstructionists May vote against Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State. The Dems will not approve hundreds of good people including the Ambassador to Germany. They are maxing out the time on approval process for all never happened before. Need more Republicans!

Kim Strassel of the WSJ just said after reviewing the dumb Comey Memos ‚Äúyou got to ask what was the purpose of the Special Counsel? There‚Äôs no there there.‚Äù Dan Henninger of the WSJ said Memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought!
Funny how all of the Pundits that couldn‚Äôt come close to making a deal on North Korea are now all over the place telling me how to make a deal!
A complete Witch Hunt!
‚ÄúI can die happy now with Trump Job performance‚Äù stated Mary Matalin. ‚ÄúA great overall President stunning!‚Äù Thank you Mary.
....We are a long way from conclusion on North Korea maybe things will work out and maybe they won‚Äôt - only time will tell....But the work I am doing now should have been done a long time ago!
Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake News NBC just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with North Korea and they have given up nothing. Wow we haven‚Äôt given up anything & they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for World) site closure & no more testing!
‚ÄúGOP Lawmakers asking Sessions to Investigate Comey and Hillary Clinton.‚Äù USERNAME   Good luck with that request!
‚ÄúAt least two Memos Comey shared with a friend contained Classified Information.‚Äù  Wall Street Journal
The Washington Post said I refer to Jeff Sessions as ‚ÄúMr. Magoo‚Äù and Rod Rosenstein as ‚ÄúMr. Peepers.‚Äù This is ‚Äúaccording to people with whom the president has spoken.‚Äù There are no such people and don‚Äôt know these characters...just more Fake & Disgusting News to create ill will!
James Comey‚Äôs Memos are Classified I did not Declassify them. They belong to our Government! Therefore he broke the law! Additionally he totally made up many of the things he said I said and he is already a proven liar and leaker. Where are Memos on Clinton Lynch & others?
Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson. His trials and tribulations were great his life complex and controversial. Others have looked at this over the years most thought it would be done but yes I am considering a Full Pardon!

James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council? Therefore the Special Council was established based on an illegal act? Really does everybody know what that means?
Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats. This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI the Debbie Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails.
North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site. This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress! Look forward to our Summit.

Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place including the fully loaded ships at sea Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!
Nancy Pelosi is going absolutely crazy about the big Tax Cuts given to the American People by the Republicans...got not one Democrat Vote! Here‚Äôs a choice. They want to end them and raise your taxes substantially. Republicans are working on making them permanent and more cuts!
So exciting! I have agreed to be the Commencement Speaker at our GREAT Naval Academy on May 25th in Annapolis Maryland. Looking forward to being there.
So General Michael Flynn‚Äôs life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I don‚Äôt think so!
James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?
James Comey just threw Andrew McCabe ‚Äúunder the bus.‚Äù Inspector General‚Äôs Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them! Getting a little (lot) of their own medicine?
Sanctuary Cities released at least 142 Gang Members across the United States making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed. We are doing a great job of law enforcement but things such as this make safety in America difficult!
My thoughts prayers and condolences are with the families friends and colleagues of the two USERNAME deputies (HEROES) who lost their lives in the line of duty today.
Mike Pompeo is outstanding. First in his class at West Point. A top student at Harvard Law School. A success at whatever he has done. We need the Senate to approve Mike ASAP. He will be a great Secretary of State!
...Hopefully the Senate will not leave Washington until our Ambassadors Judges and the people who make Washington work are approved. The Democrats are Obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our Country!
Democrats are obstructing good (hopefully great) people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our Government hence the American People. They are ‚Äúslow walking‚Äù all of my nominations - hundreds of people. At this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals!
.USERNAME is a wonderful woman who has always been there when we have needed her. Great on the Military Border Security and Crime. Loves and works hard for the people of Tennessee. She has my full endorsement and I will be there to campaign with her!

Governor Jerry Brown announced he will deploy ‚Äúup to 400 National Guard Troops‚Äù to do nothing. The crime rate in California is high enough and the Federal Government will not be paying for Governor Brown‚Äôs charade. We need border security and action not words!
Thank you San Diego County for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against California's illegal and unconstitutional 'Sanctuary' policies. California's dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our communities putting all Americans at risk.

Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week. Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed. Details of Summit are being worked out now. Denuclearization will be a great thing for World but also for North Korea!
A sketch years later about a nonexistent man. A total con job playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)! HYPERLINK
There is a Revolution going on in California. Soooo many Sanctuary areas want OUT of this ridiculous crime infested & breeding concept. Jerry Brown is trying to back out of the National Guard at the Border but the people of the State are not happy. Want Security & Safety NOW!
While Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP I don‚Äôt like the deal for the United States. Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn‚Äôt work. Bilateral deals are far more efficient profitable and better for OUR workers. Look how bad WTO is to U.S.

Rasmussen just came out at 51% Approval despite the Fake News Media. They were one of the three most accurate on Election Day. Just about the most inaccurate were CNN and ABC News/Washington Post and they haven‚Äôt changed (get new pollsters). Much of the media is a Scam!
Getting ready to meet Prime Minister Abe of Japan a truly fine gentleman!
So many people are seeing the benefits of the Tax Cut Bill. Everyone is talking really nice to see!
Looks like Jerry Brown and California are not looking for safety and security along their very porous Border. He cannot come to terms for the National Guard to patrol and protect the Border. The high crime rate will only get higher. Much wanted Wall in San Diego already started!
I am in Florida and looking forward to my meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. Working on Trade and Military Security.
Employment is up Taxes are DOWN. Enjoy!
Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the U.S. keeps raising interest rates. Not acceptable!
Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G) then based his decisions on her poll numbers. Disgruntled he McCabe and the others committed many crimes!
Just hit 50% in the Rasmussen Poll much higher than President Obama at same point. With all of the phony stories and Fake News it‚Äôs hard to believe! Thank you America we are doing Great Things.
Slippery James Comey a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!) will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history by far!
Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past. I have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices and even homes are going to be raided with everything including their phones and computers taken. All lawyers are deflated and concerned!
I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His ‚Äúmemos‚Äù are self serving and FAKE!
The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out with such precision that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term ‚ÄúMission Accomplished.‚Äù I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term it should be brought back. Use often!
Comey throws AG Lynch ‚Äúunder the bus!‚Äù Why can‚Äôt we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch? Was she promised a Supreme Court seat or AG in order to lay off Hillary. No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!
The big questions in Comey‚Äôs badly reviewed book aren‚Äôt answered like how come he gave up Classified Information (jail) why did he lie to Congress (jail) why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn‚Äôt they TAKE it) why the phony memos McCabe‚Äôs $700000 & more?
Unbelievably James Comey states that Polls where Crooked Hillary was leading were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe. In other words he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win and he wanted a job. Slimeball!
So proud of our great Military which will soon be after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars the finest that our Country has ever had. There won‚Äôt be anything or anyone even close!
A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!

....untruthful slime ball who was as time has proven a terrible Director of the FBI. His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case and the events surrounding it will go down as one of the worst ‚Äúbotch jobs‚Äù of history. It was my great honor to fire James Comey!
James Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR. Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was in fact fired. He leaked CLASSIFIED information for which he should be prosecuted. He lied to Congress under OATH. He is a weak and.....

Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation headed up by the all Democrat loyalists or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter). No Collusion so they go crazy!
Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been and that includes the Cold War. There is no reason for this. Russia needs us to help with their economy something that would be very easy to do and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race?
Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia  because they will be coming nice and new and ‚Äúsmart!‚Äù You shouldn‚Äôt be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!
....doing things that nobody thought possible despite the never ending and corrupt Russia Investigation which takes tremendous time and focus. No Collusion or Obstruction (other than I fight back) so now they do the Unthinkable and RAID a lawyers office for information! BAD!

Only fools or worse are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE and this will be changed. Also our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!
So funny to watch Fake News Networks among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased. Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC which is a total joke.
Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA...They have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic. With all of the money they make from the U.S. hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours at least until Congress changes our immigration laws!
DACA is dead because the Democrats didn‚Äôt care or act and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon... No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders hence drugs and crime!
...Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation use Nuclear Option if necessary to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT but the weak Dem laws don‚Äôt allow them to do their job. Act now Congress our country is being stolen!
Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large ‚ÄúCaravans‚Äù of people enter their country. They must stop them at their Northern Border which they can do because their border laws work not allow them to pass through into our country which has no effective border laws.....
These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA. They want in on the act!
Mexico is doing very little if not NOTHING at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border and then into the U.S. They laugh at our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows or I will stop their cash cow NAFTA. NEED WALL!
Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release. Getting more dangerous. ‚ÄúCaravans‚Äù coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!

Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe but he never took notes when he was with me. I don‚Äôt believe he made memos except to help his own agenda probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?
Wow watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked ‚Äúhave you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?‚Äù He said strongly ‚Äúnever no.‚Äù He lied as shown clearly on USERNAME.
The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!
The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife‚Äôs campaign by Crooked H friend Terry M who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all and much more!
As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are now finding out however there was tremendous leaking lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI Justice & State. #DrainTheSwamp

If we don‚Äôt have a wall system we‚Äôre not going to have a country. Congress must fund the BORDER WALL & prohibit grants to sanctuary jurisdictions that threaten the security of our country & the people of our country. We must enforce our laws & protect our people! #BuildTheWall HYPERLINK
California‚Äôs sanctuary policies are illegal and unconstitutional and put the safety and security of our entire nation at risk. Thousands of dangerous & violent criminal aliens are released as a result of sanctuary policies set free to prey on innocent Americans. THIS MUST STOP!

The Pittsburgh Post Gazette just endorsed Rick Saccone for Congress. He will be much better for steel and business. Very strong on experience and what our Country needs. Lamb will always vote for Pelosi and Dems....Will raise taxes weak on Crime and Border.
If schools are mandated to be gun free zones violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter. Almost all school shootings are in gun free zones. Cowards will only go where there is no deterrent!
....On 18 to 21 Age Limits watching court cases and rulings before acting. States are making this decision. Things are moving rapidly on this but not much political support (to put it mildly).
Very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House. Legislation moving forward. Bump Stocks will soon be out. Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry subject to State Law. Armed guards OK deterrent!.......
Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross will be speaking with representatives of the European Union about eliminating the large Tariffs and Barriers they use against the U.S.A. Not fair to our farmers and manufacturers.

The Republicans are 5-0 in recent Congressional races a point which the Fake News Media continuously fails to mention. I backed and campaigned for all of the winners. They give me credit for one. Hopefully Rick Saccone will be another big win on Tuesday.

The European Union wonderful countries who treat the U.S. very badly on trade are complaining about the tariffs on Steel & Aluminum. If they drop their horrific barriers & tariffs on U.S. products going in we will likewise drop ours. Big Deficit. If not we Tax Cars etc. FAIR!
In the first hours after hearing that North Korea‚Äôs leader wanted to meet with me to talk denuclearization and that missile launches will end the press was startled & amazed.They couldn‚Äôt believe it. But by the following morning the news became FAKE.They said so what who cares!
North Korea has not conducted a Missile Test since November 28 2017 and has promised not to do so through our meetings. I believe they will honor that commitment!

Chinese President XI XINPING and I spoke at length about the meeting with KIM JONG UN of North Korea. President XI told me he appreciates that the U.S. is working to solve the problem diplomatically rather than going with the ominous alternative. China continues to be helpful!

The deal with North Korea is very much in the making and will be if completed a very good one for the World. Time and place to be determined.

Will be making a decision soon on the appointment of new Chief Economic Advisor. Many people wanting the job - will choose wisely!
Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!
Federal Judge in Maryland has just ruled that ‚ÄúPresident Trump has the right to end DACA.‚Äù President Obama had 8 years to fix this problem and didn‚Äôt. I am waiting for the Dems they are running for the hills!

Total inaction on DACA by Dems. Where are you? A deal can be made!
The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come & go and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos only great Energy!
It‚Äôs March 5th and the Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA. Gave them 6 months they just don‚Äôt care. Where are they? We are ready to make a deal!
Why did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the Election in November? Wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win. Unprecedented. Bigger than Watergate! Plus Obama did NOTHING about Russian meddling.
To protect our Country we must protect American Steel! #AMERICA FIRST
...treat our farmers much better. Highly restrictive. Mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the U.S. They have not done what needs to be done. Millions of people addicted and dying.
We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada. NAFTA which is under renegotiation right now has been a bad deal for U.S.A. Massive relocation of companies & jobs. Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed. Also Canada must..
We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals. Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the U.S. for many years. Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead. Sorry it‚Äôs time for a change! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The Gridiron Dinner last night was great fun. I am accomplishing a lot in Washington and have never had a better time doing something and especially since this is for the American People!
If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!
The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our ‚Äúvery stupid‚Äù trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more!

....History shows that a school shooting lasts on average 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained gun adept teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!
....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A ‚Äúgun free‚Äù school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!
I never said ‚Äúgive teachers guns‚Äù like was stated on Fake News USERNAME & USERNAME. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving ‚Äúconcealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers a lot would now be able to

‚ÄúThere is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America‚Äôs elections there‚Äôs no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time and so I‚Äôd invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes.‚Äù .....

If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord disruption and chaos within the U.S. then with all of the Committee Hearings Investigations and Party hatred they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America!
Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats lead by their fearless leader Crooked Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election. But wasn‚Äôt I a great candidate?
I never said Russia did not meddle in the election I said ‚Äúit may be Russia or China or another country or group or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.‚Äù The Russian ‚Äúhoax‚Äù was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!
Finally Liddle‚Äô Adam Schiff the leakin‚Äô monster of no control is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something. Obama was President knew of the threat and did nothing. Thank you Adam!
Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $1.7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress the FBI or Justice called for an investigation!
General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier Uranium Speeches Emails and the Podesta Company!
Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!
Just like they don‚Äôt want to solve the DACA problem why didn‚Äôt the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn‚Äôt want to and now they just talk!

While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA!
So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities again and again!

My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.
Today I was honored to be joined by Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate as well as members of my Cabinet - to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore America‚Äôs depleted infrastructure. HYPERLINK HYPERLINK

Negotiations on DACA have begun. Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal. Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if we could finally after so many years solve the DACA puzzle. This will be our last chance there will never be another opportunity! March 5th.
Our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except of course the Democrats. After many years we have taken care of our Military now we have to fix our roads bridges tunnels airports and more. Bipartisan make deal Dems?
The journey to #MAGA began USERNAME 2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something I look forward to every year. See you at #CPAC2018!

Rep. Lou Barletta a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters will make a FANTASTIC Senator. He is strong & smart loves Pennsylvania & loves our Country! Voted for Tax Cuts unlike Bob Casey who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer!
4.2 million hard working Americans have already received a large Bonus and/or Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut & Jobs Bill....and it will only get better! We are far ahead of schedule.
So many positive things going on for the U.S.A. and the Fake News Media just doesn‚Äôt want to go there. Same negative stories over and over again! No wonder the People no longer trust the media whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history!    #MAGA
My Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border ending chain migration and canceling the visa lottery. Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans. HYPERLINK
My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers their families and everybody at the USERNAME. HYPERLINK
Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do. The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011 and they decided not to do anything about DACA. They only want to use it as a campaign issue. Vote Republican!
....agencies not just the FBI & DOJ now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election. Comey had conversations with Donald Trump which I don‚Äôt believe were accurate...he leaked information (corrupt).‚Äù Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on USERNAME
‚ÄúMy view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the Clinton/DNC Dossier it shows that he‚Äôs been victimized. He‚Äôs been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of.......
Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?
According to the USERNAME a Russian sold phony secrets on ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù to the U.S. Asking price was $10 million brought down to $1 million to be paid over time. I hope people are now seeing & understanding what is going on here. It is all now starting to come out - DRAIN THE SWAMP!
The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew because of sources and methods (and more) would have to be heavily redacted whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency. Told them to re-do and send back in proper form!
Jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low!
Costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election and beyond. This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military but much waste in order to get Dem votes. Fortunately DACA not included in this Bill negotiations to start now!
Without more Republicans in Congress we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally after many years of depletion take care of our Military. Sadly we needed some Dem votes for passage. Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election!
Just signed Bill. Our Military will now be stronger than ever before. We love and need our Military and gave them everything ‚Äî and more. First time this has happened in a long time. Also means JOBS JOBS JOBS!
Wow! -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch. Warner did not want a ‚Äúpaper trail‚Äù on a ‚Äúprivate‚Äù meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame. All tied into Crooked Hillary.

Great jobs numbers and finally after many years rising wages- and nobody even talks about them. Only Russia Russia Russia despite the fact that after a year of looking there is No Collusion!
This memo totally vindicates ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!
Rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49% a far better number than I had in winning the Election and higher than certain ‚Äúsacred cows.‚Äù Other Trump polls are way up also. So why does the media refuse to write this? Oh well someday!

Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans & Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8 but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security. The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer!

#AMERICA FIRST!
For those asking the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate and they need 60. That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election! We can then be even tougher on  Crime (and Border) and even better to our Military & Veterans!
This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #DemocratShutdown
Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border. They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess!
Not looking good for our great Military or Safety & Security on the very dangerous Southern Border. Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts and what they are doing for our booming economy.
Excellent preliminary meeting in Oval with USERNAME - working on solutions for Security and our great Military together with USERNAME McConnell and USERNAME. Making progress - four week extension would be best!
Just signed 702 Bill to reauthorize foreign intelligence collection. This is NOT the same FISA law that was so wrongly abused during the election. I will always do the right thing for our country and put the safety of the American people first!

Will be going to Pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to RICK SACCONE running for Congress in a Special Election (March 13). Rick is a great guy. We need more Republicans to continue our already successful agenda!
....The Wall will be paid for directly or indirectly or through longer term reimbursement by Mexico which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. The $20 billion dollar Wall is ‚Äúpeanuts‚Äù compared to what Mexico makes from the U.S. NAFTA is a bad joke!
The Wall is the Wall it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it. Parts will be of necessity see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains wastelands or tough rivers or water.....

The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security. The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military at a time we need it more than ever. We need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now! No more dangerous Lottery.
We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER and we must have a great WALL to help protect us and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!
Senator Dicky Durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting. Deals can‚Äôt get made when there is no trust! Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our Military.

DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don‚Äôt really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military.
...and they knew exactly what I said and meant. They just wanted a story. FAKE NEWS!
The Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them ‚ÄúI have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un‚Äù (of N. Korea). Obviously I didn‚Äôt say that. I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un‚Äù a big difference. Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters...
So much Fake News is being reported. They don‚Äôt even try to get it right or correct it when they are wrong. They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author who knowingly writes false information. The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election!
I don‚Äôt believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA. They are all talk and no action. This is the time but day by day they are blowing the one great opportunity they have. Too bad!
Yesterday was another big day for jobs and the Stock Market. Chrysler coming back to U.S. (Michigan) from Mexico and many more companies paying out Tax Cut money to employees. If Dems won in November Market would have TANKED! It was headed for disaster.

Sadly Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal not a fair deal for DACA. Take care of our Military and our Country FIRST!
The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA!
....Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety DACA has now taken a big step backwards. The Dems will threaten ‚Äúshutdown‚Äù but what they are really doing is shutting down our military at a time we need it most. Get smart MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
....countries which are doing badly. I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level. I want safety and security for our people. I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs. I want to fund our military not do a Dem defund....
The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards. Wall was not properly funded Chain & Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime.....
Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for ‚Äúpeanuts‚Äù only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!
The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border risking thousands of lives in the process. It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans. We must build a Great Wall think Merit and end Lottery & Chain. USA!

It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts.

Why would smart voters want to put Democrats in Congress in 2018 Election when their policies will totally kill the great wealth created during the months since the Election. People are much better off now not to mention ISIS VA Judges Strong Border 2nd A Tax Cuts & more?

The Democrats have been told and fully understand that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc. We must protect our Country at all cost!
Why is the United States Post Office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!

.USERNAME-FBI‚Äôs Andrew McCabe ‚Äúin addition to his wife getting all of this money from M (Clinton Puppet) he was using allegedly his FBI Official Email Account to promote her campaign. You obviously cannot do this. These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton.‚Äù
Remember the Republicans are 5-0 in Congressional races this year. In Senate I said Roy M would lose in Alabama and supported Big Luther Strange - and Roy lost. Virginia candidate was not a ‚ÄúTrumper‚Äù and he lost.  Good Republican candidates will win BIG!
The Stock Market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low. So many things accomplished by the Trump Administration perhaps more than any other President in first year. Sadly will never be reported correctly by the Fake News Media!

With all my Administration has done on Legislative Approvals (broke Harry Truman‚Äôs Record) Regulation Cutting Judicial Appointments Building Military VA TAX CUTS & REFORM Record Economy/Stock Market and so much more I am sure great credit will be given by mainstream news?

Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media. They are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them. Major lies written then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...a stain on America!
Getting closer and closer on the Tax Cut Bill. Shaping up even better than projected. House and Senate working very hard and smart. End result will be not only important but SPECIAL!

Sen. Jeff Flake(y) who is unelectable in the Great State of Arizona (quit race anemic polls) was caught (purposely) on ‚Äúmike‚Äù saying bad things about your favorite President. He‚Äôll be a NO on tax cuts because his political career anyway is ‚Äútoast.‚Äù
Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail LaVar Ball the father of LiAngelo is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!

The booing at the NFL football game last night when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees was loudest I have ever heard. Great anger
Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!

#StandForOurAnthem
The White House never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night. Important meetings taking place today. Big tax cuts & reform.
The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!
Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total). These are fans who demand respect for our Flag!
So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans. They won't put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag - they said it loud and clear!
Making America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet.HYPERLINK
Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!
Alaska Arizona Maine and Kentucky are big winners in the Healthcare proposal. 7 years of Repeal & Replace and some Senators not there.
Courageous Patriots have fought and died for our great American Flag --- we MUST honor and respect it!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Please to inform that the Champion Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL will be joining me at the White House for Ceremony. Great team!
Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!
...NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.
If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!
Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man they won't be around much longer!
Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.Tell them to stand!
Democrats are laughingly saying that McCain had a "moment of courage." Tell that to the people of Arizona who were deceived. 116% increase!
Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel.They are also working with North Korea.Not much of an agreement we have!
Very proud of our incredible First Lady (USERNAME.) She is a truly great representative for our country! HYPERLINK

Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitatingtherefore invitation is withdrawn!
It was great being with Luther Strange last night in Alabama. What great people what a crowd! Vote Luther on Tuesday.
Alaska had a 200% plus increase in premiums under ObamaCare worst in the country. Deductibles high people angry! Lisa M comes through.
Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do. Better control &  management. Great for Arizona. McCain let his best friend L.G. down!
Arizona had a 116% increase in ObamaCare premiums last year with deductibles very high. Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods. Sad
John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill which his Governor loves. He campaigned on Repeal & Replace. Let Arizona down!
Heading to Alabama now big crowd!

The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest! Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister!
Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is "sick." All G 20 leaders and spouses were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!
The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes. Even parts of full Repeal need 60. 8 Dems control Senate. Crazy!
With only a very small majority the Republicans in the House & Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct no votes!
As I have always said let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!
We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans. Most Republicans were loyal terrific & worked really hard. We will return!

states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!
It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4--

The failing USERNAME just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high. I can fully understand that - but why announce?
Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the USERNAME. In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone!
I cancelled today's meeting with the failing USERNAME when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice

Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice!
The USERNAME sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?

Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?
Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT! Hillary was set up by a con.
Wow Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an "angel" without checking her past which is terrible!

Now that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities they want TRUMP!
Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or as stated by Bernie S she has BAD JUDGEMENT

How quickly people forget that Crooked Hillary called African-American youth "SUPER PREDATORS" - Has she apologized?
I am very proud to have brought the subject of illegal immigration back into the discussion. Such a big problem for our country-I will solve
What do African-Americans and Hispanics have to lose by going with me. Look at the poverty crime and educational statistics. I will fix it!

CLINTON CORRUPTION AND HER SABOTAGE OF THE INNER CITIES. Full speech transcript: HYPERLINK
Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me. No policy and always very short (stamina). Media gives her a pass!
HRC is using the oldest play in the Dem playbook- when their policies fail they are left w/this one tired argument!HYPERLINK
Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!
Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!
Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering!
So many in the African-American community are doing so badly poverty and crime way up employment and jobs way down: I will fix it promise
Poll numbers are starting to look very good. Leading in Florida USERNAME Arizona and big jump in Utah. All numbers rising national way up. Wow!

President Obama should have gone to Louisiana days ago instead of golfing. Too little too late!
Hillary Clinton strongly stated  that there was "absolutely no connection" between her private work and that of The State Department. LIE!
It is being reported by virtually everyone and is a fact  that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history!
I am now in Texas doing a big fundraiser for the Republican Party and a USERNAME Special on the BORDER and with victims of border crime!
The USERNAME quickly put together a hit job book on me- comprised of copies of some of their inaccurate stories. Don't buy boring!
.USERNAME's new book 'In Trump We Trust comes out tomorrow. People are saying it's terrific - knowing Ann I am sure it is!
Just leaving Akron Ohio after a packed rally. Amazing people! Going now to Texas.

"USERNAME:  USERNAME Video: Hillary referring to blacks as super predators that need to be brought to heel. HYPERLINK
I heard that USERNAME was very nice on Friday but that little Donny D a big failure in TV (& someone I helped) was nasty. Irrelevant!
Crooked Hillary is flooding the airwaves with false and misleading ads - all paid for by her bosses on Wall Street. Media is protecting her!
I have been drawing very big and enthusiastic crowds but the media refuses to show or discuss them. Something very big is happening!
Together we are going to MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!HYPERLINK

Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!
"Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade jobs military vets 2nd A repeal Ocare borders etc - but media misrepresents!
I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!
I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!
Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!
My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say I would be beating Hillary by 20%
The failing USERNAME which never spoke to me keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False I am who I am-never said
The failing USERNAME talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!
"USERNAME: You are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #USA Loves U" Thanks
"USERNAME: We're all enjoying you as well Mr. T.! You've inspired Hope and a Positive Spirit throughout America! God bless you!" Nice
"USERNAME:  USERNAME yes you are my hero I admire you for laying down your glorious luxurious life to get beat up for America!!!"
We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres.
"USERNAME: Thank you for all that you are doing for us! You campaign endlessly and have spent millions.We love you! #TrumpTrain" Thanks
I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th!
The failing USERNAME has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources. Very dishonest!
Will be on USERNAME tonight at 10pm hosted by USERNAME. Enjoy!

ISIS gained tremendous strength during Hillary Clinton's term as Secretary of State. When will the dishonest media report the facts!
I love watching these poor pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't!
A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!
"USERNAME: Thank you for coming to Pennsylvania today. I will be there with USERNAME your 3rd CD delegate at 2 pm"
Ratings challenged USERNAME reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) "the founder" of ISIS & MVP. THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?
I'm with YOU. I will work hard and never let you down. Make America Great Again! HYPERLINK
"USERNAME: USERNAME USERNAME USERNAME People gotta stop believing media lies about Trump." That would indeed be nice!
"USERNAME: THE CORRUPT MEDIA CREATS CONTROVERSY AGAINST USERNAME TO AVOID ISSUES ABOUT HillaryClinton HYPERLINK

Thank you Fort Lauderdale Florida. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain HYPERLINK
Great job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber.

Morning Joe's weakness is its low ratings. I don't watch anymore but I heard he went wild against Rudy Giuliani and #2A - sad & irrelevant!

"USERNAME: ‚ÄòNow cut off my mic!‚Äô Bongino refuses to be bullied by Don Lemon over Trump 2nd Amendment ‚Äì HEATED! HYPERLINK
Media desperate to distract from Clinton's anti-2A stance. I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution!
When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed like Libya open borders and maybe her emails?

When will CNN do a segment on Hillary‚Äôs plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost?
Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against Radical Islam.
Hillary whose decisions have led to the deaths of many accepted $ from a business linked to ISIS. Silence at CNN. HYPERLINK

People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something!
The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.
Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?
When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department?
CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime failing schools and vanishing jobs.
CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.

So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!
When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine you can mark it down" I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!
This story is not about Mr. Khan who is all over the place doing interviews but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!
Mr. Khan who does not know me viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!
Wow it is unbelievable how distorted one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing USERNAME is a joke. USERNAME is laughable!
"USERNAME:  Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media HillaryClinton wouldn't stand a chance. #VoterFraud and #MSM her only hope."
The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why then my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?
I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war not me!
Captain Khan killed 12 years ago was a hero but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our "leaders" to eradicate it!
We crushed the original goal! I will write a $2 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our end-of-month goal!  HYPERLINK

#CrookedHillary = Obama's third term which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. HYPERLINK
Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics they will do much better!
Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "Big Thursdays" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings
#CrookedHillary HYPERLINK
Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime supports open borders and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!
Violent crime is rising across the United States yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.
I will write a $2 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal! HYPERLINK

We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years. I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not.
Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes.
Colorado was amazing yesterday! So much support. Our tax trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country.

What Bernie Sanders really thinks of Crooked Hillary Clinton. HYPERLINK
I am watching Crooked Hillary speak. Same old stuff our country needs change!
Wow my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out V.P. pick!
In Hillary Clinton's America - things get worse. #TrumpPence16 HYPERLINK
The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech. He wishes he didn't make that deal!
Thank you! Facebook: HYPERLINK HYPERLINK HYPERLINK
Crooked Hillary said that I "couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign." ReallyI just beat 16 people and am beating her!
If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town!  #NeverHillary
"Little" Michael Bloomberg who never had the guts to run for president knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!
General John Allen who I never met but spoke against me last night failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD  #NeverHillary
Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!

Two policemen just shot in San Diego one dead. It is only getting worse. People want LAW AND ORDER!
Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me and "forgot" to mention the many problems of our country in her very average scream!
The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. USERNAME and the little watched USERNAME = SAD!
No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction terrorism and ISIS across the world.
Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power no jobs no safety.
Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!
Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.
I will once again write a $1 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal! HYPERLINK

Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic
Our not very bright Vice President Joe Biden just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe that was Ted Cruz!
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!
Funny how the failing USERNAME is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st!
As I have been saying Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.
Just like I have warned from the beginning Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP. HYPERLINK
I hate to say it but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!
No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!
You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. USERNAME

For the record I have ZERO investments in Russia.
In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!
Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.
Bernie's exhausted he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!
The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!

Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.
Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS bad trade deals broken borders police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great
Funny if you listen to USERNAME the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two they are fawning. What a difference
Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.
Elizabeth Warren often referred to as Pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary who she always hated!
Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.
I was at USERNAME and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!
Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time energy and money. The V.P. a joke!
While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP is in pocket of Wall Street and backed Iraq War.

Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA
The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!
Wow the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!
Here we go again with another Clinton scandal and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in B never had a chance!
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught that's all! They laughed at Bernie.
If Bernie Sanders after seeing the just released e-mails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same.
Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain HYPERLINK
Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails using even religion against Bernie!
The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails which should never have been written (stupid) because Putin likes me
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!
The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good but for the final night my speech great. Thank you!
The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory she's out!
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!
Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!
Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out
If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie) media would go wild
The USERNAME panels are so one sided almost all against Trump. USERNAME is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!
I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted no energy left!
Today proves what I have always known that USERNAME Priebus is the tough one and the smart one not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (USERNAME.)
Sorry folks but Bernie Sanders is exhausted just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!
There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end!
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not their BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!
Wow President Obama's brother Malik just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
Bernie Sanders started off strong but with the selection of Kaine for V.P. is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT
The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!

"USERNAME: USERNAME Dinesh D'Sousa Hillary's America. see it"
"USERNAME: USERNAME Kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals HYPERLINK #HillaryKaine2016"
Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!
The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her unless he is a fraud!
Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!
I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes really vicious. RIGGED
Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also Crooked Hillary hates her!
Tim Kaine is and always has been owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!
The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?
"USERNAME: USERNAME General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain"
I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.
Another attack this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.

STATEMENT ON MELANIA SPEECHHYPERLINK
The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.
Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!
In November I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!
Bill Hemmer of USERNAME was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.
Congratulations to my children Don and Tiffany on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you!

It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes!
Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes Crooked Hillary Clinton can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money!
Crooked Hillary who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what's happening!
Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience yet look what her policies have done

Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!
On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.
Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.

Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.
#CrookedHillary is not qualified!HYPERLINK
I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!
Bernie Sanders who has lost most of his leverage has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!
This election is a choice between law order & safety - or chaos crime & violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou

Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live.
I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes USERNAME USERNAME
Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd a man with so little touch for politics is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.
Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.
Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center Airport - and destroyed City
I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes now many bankruptcies.
Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch her time will come!
The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges but...HYPERLINK HYPERLINK
Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest incompetent and of very bad judgement.
Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information." Not fit!
Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!
I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8 she's out!
Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win
I will be interviewed by USERNAME tonight on USERNAME at 11pm. Enjoy!
My son USERNAME will be interviewed by USERNAME tonight at 10pm on USERNAME. Enjoy!
Looking forward to meeting with USERNAME in a little while. We will be traveling to North Carolina together today.
FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem
The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual bad judgment.
It was great spending time with USERNAME yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again!
Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!
On USERNAME at 7:00 P.M. "Special: Meet the Trumps" Hope you enjoy!
Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?
With Hillary and Obama the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!
Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33000 missing e-mails?
The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!
I look forward to meeting USERNAME today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!
Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed great people!
Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd the end result was solid!
Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star or plain star!
Happy 4th of July! #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst HYPERLINK HYPERLINK
Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!
The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!
In Bangladesh hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!
I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away no pictures."
Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?
"THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!"
On Saturday a great man Elie Wiesel passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged & corrupt!
Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
Just watched USERNAME and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd and the entire show is against me.The good news-the people get it!
It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said the system is totally rigged!
It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!

Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?
Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.
As Bernie Sanders said Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!
#ThrowbackThursday #Trump2016HYPERLINK
I will be interviewed by USERNAME tonight at 10pm on FOX! Enjoy!
The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!
The very dishonest USERNAME refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal!
One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America. HYPERLINK
Why would college graduates want Crooked Hillary as their President? She will destroy them! HYPERLINK

Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was. The media makes everything up!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is a fraud who has put the public and country at risk by her illegal and very stupid use of e-mails. Many missing!
Join me in San Jose California- tomorrow evening at 7pm! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016HYPERLINK HYPERLINK
So I raised/gave $5600000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad! They do anything to belittle - totally biased.
Congratulations to USERNAME on his tremendous increase in television ratings. Speaking of ratings- I will be on his show tonight USERNAME 10pE.
I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days.
Katie Couric the third rate reporter who has been largely forgotten should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc.
I will be interviewed on USERNAME tonight at 10pmE on USERNAME. Enjoy!
Join me in Sacramento California-tomorrow evening USERNAME 7pm! #Trump2016HYPERLINK HYPERLINK
So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor - they do an amazing job.
Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5600000 that I raised/gave!
I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch!
So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! News conference at 11:00 A.M. today Trump Tower!
I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge Gonzalo Curiel who is totally biased against me.
I have a judge in the Trump University civil case Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego) who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biased-hates Trump
I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day!
I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent instead of sixteen. Broke record
Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The endorsement of me by the 16500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice!
In getting the endorsement of the 16500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you) the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!
Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.
If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent say good bye to the Supreme Court!
The Republican Party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!
Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser but if the GOP can't control their own then they are not a party. Be tough R's!
Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.
Heading to D.C. to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER. Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY. Great spirit!
Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them.
Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW
Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!
I am always on the front page of the failing USERNAME but when I won the GOP nomination I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!
The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money & get much better results! What we need as Prez!
The failing USERNAME wrote a story about my management style & that I don't have many people. I have 73 Hillary has 800- & I'm beating her.
I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you.
The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH

Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. Hillary doesn't have it

A wonderfully written article concerning Israel by USERNAME HYPERLINK
A great new book has been written about Crooked Hillary. Read it & you will never be able to vote for her. USERNAME HYPERLINK
Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly she suffers from plain old bad judgement!
I just released my financial disclosure forms the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!
Amazingly with all of the money I have raised for the vets I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.
Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.
While under no obligation to do so I have raised between 5 & 6 million dollars including 1million dollars from me for our VETERANS. Nice!

Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees. We can‚Äôt allow this. Time to get smart and protect America!
How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam which horribly oppresses women?
Why do the networks continue to put dopey USERNAME on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs?
Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! Would be four more years of stupidity!
Crooked Hillary said that I  want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!
"USERNAME: I trust USERNAME more anyone ever to protect America.He WILL do the right thing for the U.S.A without a  doubt.

Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary!
While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day the TSA is falling apart just like our government! Airports a total disaster!
Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person!

Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will and must win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money

On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!
Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!
Wow just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!
I am happy to hear how badly the USERNAME is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant!

Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.
Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!

Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him

I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie!
Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun!
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!
Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.

Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain HYPERLINK
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!HYPERLINK
Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand?? HYPERLINK
This was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility she changed her tune. HYPERLINK
Victory press conference was over. Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges? HYPERLINK
Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened that is before she found out the episode was on tape?
Wow Corey Lewandowski my campaign manager and a very decent man was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!
How come the USERNAME & USERNAME show the new USERNAME Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz?
I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.
Wow USERNAME has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight!
We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games we must be smart tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN & MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!
Lyin' Ted I have already beaten you in all debates and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs & illegal imm!
Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak & losing big so now he wants to debate again. But according to DrudgeTime and on-line polls I have won all debates
After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb Rand Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries no way he would ever endorse me!
"USERNAME:  Cruz will say anything that is contrary to what you have to say. If you're for Motherhood he'll be against it!"
Just released that international gangs are all over our cities. This will end when I am President!
"USERNAME:  Campaign-to-date popular GOP totals: USERNAME 7546980; USERNAME 5481737; USERNAME 2724749" A BIG DIFFERENCE
Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism as well as current mission but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE a must!
A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American. When will our so-called "leaders" ever learn!
"Kirsten Powers: Anti- Trump Operative was Aggressively Shopping Cruz Story" via the Gateway Pundit: HYPERLINK
"USERNAME: USERNAME We stand by Trump 100%"  Thank you!
I will be interviewed on USERNAME at 7:30. Things are looking good had a great Easter-look forward to spending the week in Wisconsin!
"USERNAME: #WIPrimary USERNAME will defeat ISIS and #MakeAmericaGreatAgain HYPERLINK
The United States cannot continue to make such bad one-sided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more!
See Lyin' Ted even the USERNAME (no fan of mine) says this story came from Rubio not Trump! HYPERLINK
Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming
Why can't the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great!  JOBS!
Another radical Islamic attack this time in Pakistan targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead400 injured. I alone can solve
Happy Easter to all have a great day!
My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U.S. are now finally receiving plaudits!
Wow sleepy eyes USERNAME is at it again. He is do totally biased. The things I am saying are correct. - far better vision than the others
I am interviewed on This Week on USERNAME this morning. Enjoy!
Remember I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters I am not bought like others!
Don't believe the USERNAME Polls they are just another phony hit job on me. I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election.
Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S. jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs
Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story!
The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite!
The media is so after me on women  Wow this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!
"USERNAME: USERNAME USERNAME USERNAME USERNAME WOMEN LOVE TRUMP. TRUMP'S EXECS PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE. #WOMEN4TRUMP"
"USERNAME: Dear USERNAME after doing a quick Google & Twitter search there are over 15000 women's groups supporting DonaldTrump. Stop Lying."
"USERNAME:  Let me help you Trumpophobes with math: Trump: ($10.3B-$1.2M 74' equity)/1.2M = 858233%. S&P: 1314.5% #Derp"
"USERNAME: Turns out USERNAME was wrong. USERNAME had nothing to do with it HYPERLINK
"USERNAME: Your instincts on foreign policy & terrorism have been better than all of these so called experienced politicians combined."
Top suspect in Paris massacre Salah Abdeslam who also knew of the Brussels attack is no longer talking. Weak leaders ridiculous laws!
"USERNAME: #LyingTed blames USERNAME for so many things I am starting to think he is having a mental health crisis."
Wow just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one - by a lot?
I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence Lyin' Ted!
Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! HYPERLINK
Endorsements for Lyin' Ted Cruz- HYPERLINK
"USERNAME: USERNAME Cruz & Rubio are scared! WATCH -&gt; HYPERLINK HYPERLINK
Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad!
Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also many in U.S.  I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem!
"USERNAME:  USERNAME They're all brain-dead puppets with skeletons in their closet. I say you go on and destroy them all" A dead show
Explain how the women on The View which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left ever got their jobs. USERNAME is wasting time
.USERNAME T.V. show which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on. I TELL THEM "NO"
Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE I WILL SOLVE - AND FAST!
"USERNAME:  USERNAME Talkers think about the future Doers are already building it" #VoteTrump2016 HYPERLINK
It is amazing how often I am right only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration take the oil build the wall Muslims NATO!
Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a "hell hole" and a mess and the failing USERNAME wrote a critical article. I was so right!
These politicians like Cruz and Graham who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better!
.USERNAME and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION! Both talk about ISIS do nothing!
It is amazing how USERNAME gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly (ZERO) in his pres run!
"USERNAME: .USERNAME thank God is not a politician but he's one heck of a fighter who will fight for us the people."
We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate and the time is now!
N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!
"USERNAME: "A picture is worth a thousand words" USERNAME  #LyingTed #NeverCruz  USERNAME HYPERLINK
"USERNAME: USERNAME Donald Trump will be greater  president than Ragan. Trump will set the button for moralityChristianity.
"USERNAME: USERNAME USERNAME self-funded and media loves him. Not beholden to masters like USERNAME. Who owns Ted?"
"USERNAME:  You have over 2M followers more than than USERNAME. This says something about how America feels. #Trump2016 üá∫üá∏"
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I want to thank USERNAME for all of his help in our historic Arizona win. Could not have done it without you Joe!
While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!
I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150000000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first!
I will be the best by far in fighting terror. I‚Äôm the only one that was right from the beginning & now Lyin‚Äô Ted & others are copying me.
Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. She‚Äôs been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!
Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates Lyin‚Äô Ted Cruz. Honestly I can‚Äôt blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!
Lyin‚Äô Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from Michael Douglas‚Äî just another dishonest politician.
Thank you Arizona! #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrainHYPERLINK HYPERLINK
Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!
Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you I will never forget!
Thank you Arizona! #Trump2016#WesternTuesday #TrumpTrain HYPERLINK
Incompetent Hillary despite the horrible attack in Brussels today wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way!
Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful Lyin' Ted or I will spill the beans on your wife!
Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately & get home to Washington- where a #POTUS under a serious emergency belongs!
Obama and all others have been so weak and so politically correct that terror groups are forming and getting stronger! Shame.

Watch this clip from earlier this year. Time & time again I have been right about terrorism. It‚Äôs time to get tough! HYPERLINK
I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and it‚Äôs not even close. Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly!
Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore it is from a different world! U.S. must be vigilant and smart!
"USERNAME: Here's Trump #AIPAC2016 in case anyone missed it. It is a must watch. HYPERLINK
"USERNAME: USERNAME The media is corrupt! We The People are fighting with you."
Wow President Obama just landed in Cuba a big deal and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him. He greeted Pope and others. No respect
Big Republican Dinner tonight at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. I will be there!
"USERNAME:  USERNAME Dont worry Trump They are losing thousands of viewers and money. Roger Ailes will be telling Megyn to stop"
So the highly overrated anchor USERNAME is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show but I can't fight back? Wrong!
The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours and the media blames my supporters!
Why is it that the horrendous protesters who scream curse punch shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES  are never blamed by media? SAD!
Will be interviewed on USERNAME this morning. Enjoy!
"USERNAME: What‚Äôs USERNAME's strategy to secure the GOP nomination? I‚Äôll talk to the Republican front-runner. USERNAME."

Great to be back in Arizona!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 HYPERLINK
If crazy USERNAME didn't cover me so much on her terrible show her ratings would totally tank. She is so average in so many ways!
Crazy USERNAME says I don't (won't) go on her show and she still gets good ratings. But almost all of her shows are negative hits on me!

Heading to Phoneix. Will be arriving soon. Tomorrow a big day. Tremendous crowds expected! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Watching USERNAME- fantastic show! Has very interesting take on Paul Ryan.
Just leaving Salt Lake City Utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions. Love Utah- will be back!
Why haven't they released the final Missouri victory for us yet? Could it be because Cruz's guy runs Missouri?
I guess I have reached yet another "ceiling"  - 49.7% with four people. My highest Reuters poll yet! Thank you! HYPERLINK
Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets!

Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost!
Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich & Marco Rubio and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2
Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney the man who "choked" and let us all down is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!
Going to Salt Lake City Utah for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary
Club for Growth letter- trying to extort $1000000.00 from me. Remember I said- NO! HYPERLINK
Club For Growth tried to extort $1000000 from me. When I said NO they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful!
With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this?
.USERNAME got fired like a dog from RedStateand now he is the one leading opposition against me.
Senator USERNAME made horrible statements about USERNAME ‚Äì and then he endorsed him. No wonder nobody trusts politicians!
Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0!
Join us in Salt Lake City Utah- tonight!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016HYPERLINK
Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life!

Who should star in a reboot of Liar Liar- Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz? Let me know. HYPERLINK
Highly overrated & crazy USERNAME is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. Focus on others Megyn!
Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio. Two more days and Ohio was mine!
See you in Arizona on Friday and Saturday. HYPERLINK
Please explain to the dummies at the USERNAME  Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won according to Drudge etc. all 11 of them!
.USERNAME is bad at math. The good news is nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore especially me!
.USERNAME Editorial says "Clinton primary vote total is 8646551.Trump's is 7533692"-a knock. But she had only 3 opponents-I had 16.Apologize
The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem!
Crazy USERNAME is now complaining that  USERNAME did not defend her against me - yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough!
Great news that USERNAME has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question? I beat Cruz debating
Crazy USERNAME supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night. Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. Ted can't win!
Stuart Stevens the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad!
I will be interviewed on The O'Reilly Factor this evening at 8 pm on the Fox News Channel. USERNAME
Thank you Missouri! #Trump2016 HYPERLINK
Wow just won Missouri!
I am making a big speech the night of the USERNAME debate but I wish everyone well. Yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins!

In the last 2 weeks I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida & I won in a massive landslide.The establishment should save their $$!
Yesterday was amazing‚Äî5 victories.  Lyin‚Äô Ted Cruzhad zero. Things are going very well!
Is this what we want for a President? HYPERLINK

Can't watch Crazy Megyn anymore. Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race. With two people big & over!
"USERNAME: USERNAME USERNAME  If media wasn't so biased against Trump he would've won all of the delegates.

"USERNAME:  USERNAME USERNAME USERNAME She's choking on the results! Call her justifiable Kelly. Justifying everything she says."
"USERNAME: Was going to watch USERNAME for the primary results but saw USERNAME - looks like #CNN tonight"
Word is that despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon!
A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false.
I will bring our jobs back to the U.S. and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will "sing" again.
In presidential voting so far John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him I will beat Hillary!
Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!
Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate until I put him down.

Good morning Ohio! Some additional information from my daughter USERNAME! #VoteTrump #SuperTuesday HYPERLINK
Don't reward Mitt Romney who let us all down in the last presidential race by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA open borders etc.).
Please remember I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!
I will bring our jobs back to America fix our military and take care of our vets end Common Core and ObamaCare protect 2nd A build WALL
Rubio is weak on illegal immigration with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Kasich voted for NAFTA a disaster for Ohio and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness!
"USERNAME: USERNAME USERNAME USERNAME Listening to interview on replay of USERNAME Savage Nation #GO DONALD TRUMP !!!!!" Thanks.

LYIN' TED HYPERLINK
The failing USERNAME is truly one of the worst newspapers. They knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check. Really bad people!
Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- & should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue.
Carly Fiorina- I agree! Ted Cruz is just another politician. All talk- no action!HYPERLINK
Thank you Kevin. With unification of the party Republican wins will be massive! HYPERLINK
Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television he only watches the USERNAME
Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying!
Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie or my supporters will go to yours!
"USERNAME: It is repulsive that Trump was assaulted+politicians used that 2 further themselves+2 further victimize Trump! DISGUSTING!!"
Wow Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania not enough signatures. Big problem!
USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail! HYPERLINK
Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core! In other words education of your children from D.C. No way

The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump --- and that is fact!
We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio. No way to run a country!
Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco his State Chairman & their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote.

Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U.S. If it were not for striking oil they would be bust! Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud!
Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. Kasich is good for Mexico!

Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who as a Senator never even shows up to vote - worst record. Marco Rubio is a joke!

Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?
Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!
Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!
Wow Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks!
It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done.

New CBS National Poll just out - massive lead for Trump. The Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll is a total joke. No wonder WSJ is doing so badly!
I love being in South Carolina. We are leading big in all of the State polls - Saturday is a BIG day. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The just out USA Today National Poll where I lead by big numbers shows that in a head to head matchup I beat both Hillary and Bernie.
Amazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll.

Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada!
Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1% he should take his dumb mouthpiece USERNAME and just go home.
.USERNAME is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative!
I will beat Hillary easily but Lindsey Graham says I won't and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on?
.USERNAME who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on USERNAME.
Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I "would never be president" - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history!

RESPONSE TO THE LIES OF SENATOR CRUZ: HYPERLINK #VoteTrumpSC
JEB is a hypocrite! Used massive private "Eminent Domain" --- Just another clueless politician! HYPERLINK
Jeb used Eminent Domain & took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2)HYPERLINK
I'd like to call JEB a liar but the truth is he has no clue & never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! (1/2)
Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!) is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!
I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG BIG BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada
Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy now brother!
Ted Cruz along with Jeb Bush pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice but didn't!
Wow in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you!
Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests - the bosses!
Loved the debate last night and almost everyone said I won but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors & special ints
Thank you for your support! TOGETHER we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! HYPERLINK HYPERLINK
I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning. Enjoy!

Wow! Honored to be chosen by the highly respected + accurate Washington & Lee Mock Convention. I hope you are right - I will make you proud!

If USERNAME doesn‚Äôt clean up his act stop cheating & doing negative ads I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen.
Lightweight USERNAME is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC. False advertising- desperate and sad!
After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect & ill-informed ads.
Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution which naturally they did not get.

Jeb Bush spent more than $40000000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5 I spent $3000000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!

So funny Jeb Bush called me a "highly gifted politician and a great entertainer" - I assume that is a compliment!
Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today.

Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies."
Cruz just lied again- I am and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!
This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud HYPERLINK
I will be interviewed on USERNAME at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! USERNAME
Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
And finally Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
During primetime of the Iowa Caucus Cruz put out a release that USERNAME was quitting the race and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.
Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!
Great job on USERNAME tonight USERNAME  USERNAME begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! USERNAME
On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd! #FITN #Trump2016 HYPERLINK HYPERLINK
Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long rambling overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment!
"USERNAME USERNAME All you haters need to realize Trump got the second highest vote in history. And he's never held office!"
"USERNAME  Iowa is meaningless...keep pushing forward run the table in NH SC NV and Super Tuesday. America needs you! #TrumpTrain"
"USERNAME USERNAME Amazing job in Iowa! Cruz just barely won."
"USERNAME USERNAME if you can do that well in Iowa then I see you acing it in all other significant states. Momentum is growing"
"USERNAME USERNAME You MUST win the Presidency in 2016 !!!"
.USERNAME  USERNAME on USERNAME: He finished 2nd but he made the turn successfully like a pro"
I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign the only one. I will keep doing but not worth it!
I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd
The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!
Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor
My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice
It all begins today - WE WILL FINALLY TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

If I would have done the last debate a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also VETS got $6000000.
By not doing the failed poorly rated debate I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $6000000 for VETS.
Wow just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me will repeal & replace. He lies!
Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans scam!
Ted Cruz is totally unelectable if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!
I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!

The great State of Nebraska can do much better than USERNAME as your Senator. Saw him on USERNAME - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.
The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?

Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. & is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi low interest loans. No legal disclosure & never sold off assets.
Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.
Cruz says I supported TARP which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!
The only reason irrelevant USERNAME doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!
.USERNAME one of the National Review lightweights came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that?
Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb --- mom can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Greatly dishonest of USERNAME to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St
When will USERNAME give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.
Everybody that loves the people of New York and all they have been thru should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!
If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?
Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money does another for votes. HYPERLINK
Great new numbers. Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016HYPERLINK HYPERLINK
Ted Cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!
Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian" did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?
Oh no just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan this one from Citi. Wow no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.
The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember his wife's employer and his lender is located there!
Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!
Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable
Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so

So professional of USERNAME news to throw out the failing USERNAME newspaper from their debate. Paper won't survive highly unethical!
Great job on Fox this morning USERNAME. I am sending out for your book immediately. Thank you very much!
Congratulations to my friend USERNAME on winning a #GoldenGlobe. A wonderful guy- who has created something special- well deserved!
Why does USERNAME w/ USERNAME allow a hater & racist like USERNAME to waste good airtime? USERNAME can do much better than him!
Thank you to our law enforcement officers! #LESM #Trump2016 HYPERLINK
Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters try getting a new publisher!
UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.
This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.
If their highly unethical behavior including begging me for ads isn‚Äôt questionable enough they have endorsed a candidate who can‚Äôt win.
I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate. HYPERLINK
Remember get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch...
Heading now for Reno Nevada for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over!

Weak & ineffective USERNAME is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!

.USERNAME was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P last year plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott.
The failing USERNAME newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid how desperate!

By the way Hillary & the MSM forgot to mention that Hillary is in the Al-Shabaab terror video. HYPERLINK
The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. Just watch.
Iran with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia & their oil. THEY JUST FOUND IT!

.USERNAME of the USERNAME was terrible today on Face The Nation.No focus poor level of concentration-but correct on Hillary lying
.USERNAME said today on USERNAME that "attacking Bill to get to Hillary has never worked before." Wrong - attacked him in '08 & won!
Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton in 2008 worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST! Now Bill is at it again. Just watch.
Thank you for your support in Biloxi MS! Let's ALL get out & VOTE in 2016 so we can #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! HYPERLINK
Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!
Al-Shabbab not ISIS just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner & if I speak out against them which I must. Hillary lied!
Hillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D.T. video. The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate.
Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening.
"USERNAME: Well done #Biloxi....great display of Southern pride and hospitality at USERNAME event. Fired up and ready to go!!"

Remember I am self-funding my campaign the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.!
When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!
I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!
Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual but Hillary is not much better!
Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!
.USERNAME is a low energy "stiff" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!
.USERNAME is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!
Massive crowds expected in Mississippi tomorrow night. Look forward to it! 2015 IN PHOTOS: HYPERLINK HYPERLINK

Joe McQuaid (USERNAME) is desperately trying to sell the USERNAME. It's a loser and my comments haven't helped him much.
The dying USERNAME newspaper in NH is in turmoil over my comments about them- like a bully that got knocked out!

Joe McQuaid (USERNAME) of the dying Union Leader wanted ads lunches donations speeches from me and tweets---very unethical.
The great people of New Hampshire who I love are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper.
Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid (USERNAME) of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn't do his failed debate!
I hope USERNAME does better for Rubio than he did at the #Benghazi hearings which were a total disaster for Republicans & America!
We need a real President! HYPERLINK
Looking forward to being in Council Bluffs Iowa later today. Despite weather rally is on -- will be fantastic! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
So I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million & done. Run country my way!
My campaign for president is $35000000 under budget I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C.
"Minorities line up behind.....Donald Trump" #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain HYPERLINK HYPERLINK

Strange but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes while he will double & triple them a disaster!
Wages in are country are too low good jobs are too few  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!
Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone shipped to other countries. We now are part time sad! I WILL FIX!
The middle-class has worked so hard are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BAD
If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband with his terrible record of women abuse while playing the women's card on me she's wrong!
"USERNAME: USERNAME We need a real President to get things done and that's why we want you!"  Thank you.
Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST!
Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid!  RNC
.USERNAME-who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie!
The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!
R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!
It begins Republican Party of Virginia controlled by the RNC is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!
"USERNAME: He supports amnesty and now they are so desperate that Trey Gowdy is going to campaign with him.
"USERNAME: My prediction on the Trey Gowdy endorsement of Rubio is that it will do nothing for Rubio and finish Gowdy."

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 Story: HYPERLINK HYPERLINK
Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!
The Phoenix V.A. it has just been reported is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous and people are dying. I will fix it
The same people that said I wouldn't run or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%) now say I won't beat Hillary.
.USERNAME is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!
USERNAME just announced that TRUMP was #1 story of 2015. Totally meaningless however if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again!
"USERNAME: Thank u Mr. Trump I look forward to when u are elected next President of the United States #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. So nice!
"USERNAME:  You know what's making my Christmas Great Family/food/friends&YOU! I HAVE MY TRUMP SHIRT ON W/HOPE IN MY HEART for America"
"USERNAME:  USERNAME Thank you for your tweet today on Christmas. Can't wait to see you as President Mr. Trump. You are awesome."
"USERNAME: USERNAME USERNAME I'm reading #CrippledAmerica! Best book ever. Thank you!
When will the Democrats and Hillary in particular say "we must build a wall a great wall and Mexico is going to pay for it?" Never!
Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop I will fix this quickly!
Remember when failed candidate USERNAME said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.
We have many problems in our house (country!) and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now because of me starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!
.USERNAME was GREAT today on USERNAME  She gets what is going on in politics and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!
Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!
.USERNAME  Great job on USERNAME today. Very wise indeed!
.USERNAME Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps USERNAME will do better next year-but doubt it!
"USERNAME: USERNAME USERNAME should have talked to Megyn Kelly about this story"  True a total distortion of the facts!
I am now in Palm Beach Florida and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
.USERNAME and USERNAME very dishonest in not showing the new USERNAME Poll where I am at 39% 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!
Why isn't USERNAME using the much newer USERNAME Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better!
Wow because of the pressure put on by me ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!
Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton a totally flawed candidate and beating her soundly
Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing USERNAME are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!
Wow even lowly Rand Paul has just past USERNAME in the new USERNAME Poll. Jeb is at 3% I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!
In the ridiculous USERNAME ad about me Jeb is speaking to me during the debate but doesn't allow my answer which destroys him - SO SAD!
Poor USERNAME spent $50 million on his campaign I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone) I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!
"USERNAME: USERNAME Jim you fail to mention in your CNN POLL that in the GOP RACE...Trump is leading Cruz 39 to 18...Big Detail
A great Christmas movie & perfect #TBT! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Story: HYPERLINK HYPERLINK
"USERNAME: USERNAME why is Hillary even allowed to run... She's a criminal."
"USERNAME: USERNAME why is Hillary even allowed to run... She's a criminal."  Good question!

Hillary when you complain about "a penchant for sexism" who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!
It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New USERNAME Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead
Why does USERNAME give USERNAME so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump
.USERNAME treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out USERNAME Poll. All negative!
The USERNAME which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon today did a nasty cartoon attacking USERNAME kids. Bad
The silent majority- is silent no more! Remember the importance of VOTING!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 HYPERLINK
The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card.

We need a PRESIDENT with strength stamina heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!
It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!
When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 HYPERLINK
Wow new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!
For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged" bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM
NPR's USERNAME said "schlonged" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: "That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls." #Hypocrisy
Once again #MSM is dishonest. "Schlonged" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly.
Jeb's big ad buy against me paid for by lobbyists shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!
Watching USERNAME and consider USERNAME to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!
Women defy media narrative love Trump at packed Michigan rally.VIDEO: HYPERLINK HYPERLINK

"USERNAME: Well I'm at 42% and your at 3% .You know Jeb you started over here you keep on moving further and further off stage.  Classic"
.USERNAME's opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around incoherent.
Why doesn't USERNAME in his ads show my answer to his statement in the debate?
.USERNAME just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy. Will never work!

Going to South Carolina now great place SRO crowd. Iowa was amazing yesterday!
The media must denigrate ISIS at all levels or youth will continue to be drawn to it. These are low level degenerates NOT masterminds!
The media must immediately stop calling ISIS leaders "MASTERMINDS." Call them instead thugs and losers. Young people must not go into ISIS!

John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. A total failure!
Once John Kasich announced he was running for president and opened his mouth people realized he was a complete & total dud!
John Kasich fell right into President Obama‚Äôs trap on ObamaCare and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame!
Doesn‚Äôt help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else  - he‚Äôs almost last.
Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart!
Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun!
I want to do negative ads on John Kasich but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don‚Äôt want to waste my money.
John Kasich despite being Governor of Ohio is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!
John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image not negative ads on me.
Governor Kasich whose failed campaign & debating skills have brought him way down in the polls is going to spend $2.5 million against me.

We as a country either have borders or we don't. IF WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!
Why wouldn't the USERNAME call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong. No wonder it is doing poorly!
When and how are the dummies at the USERNAME going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me. I want "smart" trade deals.
The USERNAME Editorial Board is so wrong so often. They got info from an incorrect story in another pub. Why not watch and listen to debate.
.USERNAME Editorial Board should review my debate statement re China and T.P.P. and apologize. China not part but will get their way in later.
Today's USERNAME Editorial is WRONG again. I know that China is not in the new T.P.P. trade deal but would come in latter through a back door.

.USERNAME Thank you so much for the nice words and support--really enjoy listening to your ideas and thoughts.
I think it would be a good idea‚Äîand fair‚Äîto include USERNAME & USERNAME in the debate. Both solid & good guys. USERNAME
Carson now admits his friend named "Bob" who he tried to stab (Bob was saved by his belt buckle!) no longer exists as Bob. Wrong name!
With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it?
Such bad reporting: A puff piece on Ben Carson in the USERNAME states that Carson "is trying to solidify his lead." But I am #1 easily! Sad
Florida Ethics Commission Advocate comes down hard on Rubio. So do two people who worked with him. Said he used the wrong credit card! Sure.
"USERNAME: .USERNAME USERNAME Rubio is a Manchurian Candidate. People will own him if he ever became president."
"USERNAME: USERNAME-huge lead in Reuters National poll HYPERLINK
"USERNAME: Marco Rubio can't even handle his own credit card how is he going to be able to handle the U.S. finances #trump"
"USERNAME: USERNAME it's about time we find a republican that can take on the democrats! HYPERLINK
"USERNAME: USERNAME Interesting presidential race; Carson tries to beat his mom with a hammer and USERNAME beats Carson in the polls!
"USERNAME: USERNAME Silent majority did not try to kill their mothers like Ben Carson but wants America rebuilt by only one capable:TRUMP"
A great honor to easily finish FIRST in the USERNAME poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner!

"USERNAME: USERNAME USERNAME USERNAME No need Everyone knows Jeb is full of blank.
"USERNAME: USERNAME USERNAME JEB'S! Whole campaign is fueled by lies. Just like his brother lied about Iraq. BUSH DYNASTY=LIES"
.USERNAME should have corrected Jeb Bush when he said that I "ran for president twice." Never ran merely considered running!
"USERNAME: USERNAME I am a lifelong democrat. And I will be voting trump!!!! #democratsfortrump"  Great!
"USERNAME: USERNAME USERNAME What other candidate begins to rival Trump in his knowledge breadth of issues stamina?" Thanks!
"USERNAME: Why didn't USERNAME correct Jeb when he said USERNAME has run 4 president 2X B4~Jeb needs 2B corrected b/c he lied."
"USERNAME: Carson has the WORST health plan EVER re: Soc Sec and Medicare. USERNAME  He wants to abolish Medicare - no way!
Jeb Bush just said about Marco Rubio "he's my friend!" Pure political speak. Why can't he be truthful and say "disloyal guy no friend!"
Also tune in to the USERNAME at 7:00am. I will be on to discuss the campaign my new ads and #CrippledAmerica.

Join me Tuesday Nov. 3rd at 12 PM in #TrumpTower in NYC. I'll be signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don't miss it!
If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered!
Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a "lightweight".
I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor!
Jeb's new slogan - "Jeb can fix it". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message the word "fix" is not a good one to use in politics!
Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio  READ THIS: HYPERLINK
Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's Mr. Amnesty endorsement.Rubs can't win

I see Marco Rubio just landed another billionaire to give big money to his Superpac which are total scams. Marco must address him as "SIR"!
The new NBC POLL has me in first place but said I was third in the debate - I demand a recount (just kidding!). EVERY other poll had me #1.

I have been leading big in all  polls with two more today USERNAME and USERNAME. The NBC poll is more than double next  at 29%. Fiorina has 11%.
There is no way that Carly  Fiorina can become the Republican Nominee or win against the Dems. Boxer killed her for Senate in California!

If I would have challenged the man the media would have accused me of interfering with that man's right of free speech. A no win situation!
If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president do you really think he would come to my rescue? No chance!
This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something.
Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? I don't think so!

Saudi Arabia was "vehemently" against the Iran nuclear deal. Then today they embraced it. What happened? What did we give them to endorse?
Just announced that because of "Trump" advertising rates for debate on USERNAME are going from $5000 to $200000 a 4000% increase.PAY CHARITY?
Why would a very low ratings radio talk show host like Hugh Hewitt be doing the next debate on USERNAME. He is just a 3rd rate "gotcha" guy!
Very low ratings radio host Hugh Hewitt asked me about Suleiman Abu Bake al-Baghdad Hassan Nasrallah and more - typical "gotcha" questions

Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a "fence." It's not a fence Jeb it's a WALL and there's a BIG difference!
Asians are very offended that JEB said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics. A mess!
In a clumsy move to get out of his "anchor babies" dilemma where he signed that he would not use the term and now uses it he blamed ASIANS
Jeb Bush never uses his last name on advertising signage materials etc. Is he ashamed of the name BUSH? A pretty sad situation. Go Jeb!

Jeb Bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body. Jeb just can't get it right!
Jeb Bush is weak on illegal immigration in favor of common core bad on women's health issues and thinks the Iraq war was a good thing.
Now that I started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border most other candidates are finally  speaking up. Just politicians!

The Veterans Administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly. John McCain has done nothing to help them but talk.

Congrats to the new Gov. of Texas USERNAME for taking a tough & bold stance at the border. Should have been done long ago by Perry.
I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans. Veterans deserve universal access to care. VA scandal proves politicians are inept.
....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care.
It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans.....
I will make this right for our great Vets!
All he does is go on television is talk talk talk but incapable of doing anything.
....John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives.
The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years...
Captured or not all our soldiers are heroes!
In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President!
Just left Family Leadership Summit in Iowa got a standing ovation from many wonderful people. I will be back soon.

When will people and the media start to apologize to me for my statement "Mexico is sending...." which turned out to be true?  El Chapo
....likewise billions of dollars gets brought into Mexico    through the border. We get the killers drugs & crime they get the money!
El Chapo and the Mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a  vacuum cleaner sucking drugs and death right into the U.S.
The U.S. will invite El Chapo the Mexican drug lord who just escaped prison to become a U.S. citizen because our "leaders" can't say no!
.....but that's what I've been saying. Very unfair treatment by the media!
Now that the Mexican drug lord escaped from prison everyone is saying that most of the cocaine etc. coming into the U.S. comes over border!

Whether you think you can or think you can't you're right. -- Henry Ford
Entrepreneurs: Don't tread water. Get out there and go for it.
Entrepreneurs: Achievers move forward at all times. Achievement is not a plateau it's a beginning.
If the working proud and productive people of our country don't start exerting their authority and views the U.S. as we know it is doomed!
Why is no-one talking about the horrible murder of Ana Charle by ex-con thug West Spruill. Gunned down on street naked. Why no riots here?
Billions of dollars spent on Baltimore and it's still a total mess. Leadership is needed not dollars. Our whole country is going to hell!

I wonder what the rest of the world is thinking about the United States as they watch the disgusting and out of control Baltimore riots?
Hopefully there won't be any problems in Baltimore tonight. Be calm be cool-do not let anybody get hurt.There is just too much to live for!
The best social program by far is a JOB! Our jobs are being taken away from us by China and many other countries - incompetent leader.
President Obama you have a big job to do. Go to Baltimore and bring both sides together. With proper leadership it can be done! Do it.
Our country has to come together. We have to start working with and really liking  each other. The whole world is watching Baltimore.
"USERNAME: Can we drop USERNAME off in the middle of #Baltimore so he can show Obama how it's done?" I would fix it fast!
The Mayor of Baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters "space to destroy" - another real genius!
Now that the ineffective Baltimore  Police have allowed the city to be destroyed are the U.S. taxpayers expected to rebuild it (again)?
Our great African American President hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!
Blatant and rampant property destruction in Baltimore as the police stand by and watch. Should be a lesson on how NOT to handle riots. SAD!
Wow 15 policemen hurt in Baltimore some badly! Where is the National Guard. Police must get tough and fast! Thugs must be stopped.

China has a backdoor into the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This deal does not address currency manipulation. China is laughing at us.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership will lead to even greater unemployment. Do not pass it.

Who is the moron who decided to release the Ferguson grand jury findings after 9:00 o'clock in the evening. What were they thinking?
Our country is totally fractured and with our weak leadership in Washington you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places
Sadly because president Obama has done such a poor job as president you won't see another black president for generations!
As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the U.S. economically they laugh at us and our president over the riots in Ferguson!
Can you imagine what Putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the U.S. as they watch the Ferguson riot
If the decision by the grand jury in Ferguson was the exact opposite you would still be having the riots right now!
Despite having a black president the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades.If Obama were a  leader this would not be the case

Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9:00 in the evening - a prime time for riots! Not smart.
Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal. Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators!
ISIS is starting its own currency. May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented.
There is no excuse for riots in Ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome.

USERNAME  I have watched Open Championships at Turnberry one of the great golf courses of the World. Pinehurst not in the same league
USERNAME  My position on Pinehurst is correct - bad for the game a dried out cow pasture. You have no clue but keep trying!
Johnny Miller correctly very critical of greens at Pinehurst. Said they should be "redone"

"USERNAME: USERNAME please don't let the USGA ruin your course in 2017 like they did Pinehurst."  I won't!
"USERNAME: USERNAME they think the course should be "old school" you know like "before lawn care technology" aka goats!"

"USERNAME: USERNAME Watching the #USOpen It's as if they're playing on a local community golf course! Looks awful!"
I have been very consistent and always said that Iraq would fall as soon as the U.S. left. What a terrible waste of lives and money!
Iran will convince our incompetent President that they are trying to help us with Iraq take over the country & oil and "O" will say thanks
Turnberry in Scotland is a far superior golf course to Pinehurst - and it isn't even close! Likewise the Blue Monster at Doral.
Iran is moving troops into Iraq under the guise that it is helping out. Actually they will take over Iraq and all of their oil. Stupid U.S.

Putin has become a big hero in Russia with an all time high popularity. Obama on the other hand has fallen to his lowest ever numbers. SAD

President Obama be cool be smart be sharp and FOCUS (no more March Madness) and you can beat Putin at his own game. IT CAN BE DONE!

I don't hate Obama at all I just think he is an absolutely terrible president maybe the worst in our history!
We're spending a fortune looking for the lost plane with mostly Chinese passengers and that's OK-but how much are Russia & China spending?
President Obama was able to fool the Americans by getting elected but not able to fool Vladimir Putin. Too bad for us!

Passion gives great momentum and can be the catalyst for great achievement.
Give your goals substance. Imbue them with a value that exceeds the monetary. Make them count on as many levels as you can.

ALWAYS TRY TO LEARN FROM OTHER PEOPLES MISTAKES NOT YOUR OWN - IT IS MUCH CHEAPER THAT WAY!

USERNAME                        "USERNAME Thank you for saving new york from another Spitzer era."  We got lucky!
Putin is having such a good time. Our President is making him look like the genius of all geniuses. Do not fearwe are a NATION OF POTENTIAL
I said that Eliot Spitzer was going to lose when he was way up in the polls. I fought him when others retreated out of fear. NEVER GIVE UP!
Spitzer and Weiner lost lightweight Eric Schneiderman will be next - he will be challenged in the PRIMARY. He has done a really poor job!
"USERNAME: USERNAME He must go... People like him r destroying our country and our principals!"  Re lightweight A.G. Schneiderman
"USERNAME: USERNAME my husband and I think you're so awesome!! We can't wait to come to NYC one day and see the Trump towers!" Great!

Weiner is gone Spitzer is gone - next will be lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman. Is he a crook? Wait and see worse than Spitzer or Weiner
Assad hit the jackpot!
Back to work for the President to try and keep some dignity for the office and himself. The so-called rebels must be thoroughly confused!
The only reason Obama gave a speech last night was because it was on the schedule-Putin is laughing and the reviews have been really bad!
"USERNAME: USERNAME you are the greatest.. Thank you. #staygreat!"  I will be working hard on that!
"USERNAME: USERNAME Think Weiner will move to a state that doesn't know him?" He should move better for him to make a new start
Lightweight Attorney General Eric Schneiderman will be next to lose. He goes after a school with a 98% approval ratingleaves biggies alone
Lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman asked us for political contributions DURING his investigation of usthen sued for $40 million.Dopey guy!

"USERNAME: USERNAME I remember when Schneiderman was 2nd in command to Patterson on the D side. Can you believe those two?
Thank you to all of my Twitter followers for helping to defeat Weiner and Spitzer. Remember in the beginning they said it couldn't be done!
I fought hard against Spitzer and Weiner and both lost. For a while when Spitzer was way up it seemed that I was a lone voice! Good power
"USERNAME: USERNAME What will you miss most about Wiener?"  Absolutely nothing!
"USERNAME: USERNAME Give credit where it is due. NYC voters chose correctly."
Wow Eliot Spitzer has lost - great news for New York City!
Bottom line I don't think President changed people's minds - must hope for a lifeline from Putin a very dangerous lifeline at that!
We will have to see what Russia's next move will be. They may have given him an out of an embarrassing situation or drove into deeper mess!
He is working hard and for that he must be given credit!
"USERNAME: USERNAME why wasn't Obama more concerned w/Benghazi #americans killed. Syria not our business"
Doesn't want to remove Assad - worries what comes next.
Making his case in a nice and articulate manner.
Does he look sharp smart and presidential-his hands keep hitting the podium making a loud and distracting noise-microphone too sensitive.

"USERNAME: USERNAME The 0bama presidency has been a disaster for America"
"USERNAME: USERNAME Putin is much smarter than Obama. No surprise his tactics."
"USERNAME: .USERNAME you want to send more Americans out to war? Why don't you sign up?"  I am against an attack on Syria dummy!
Red line statement was a disaster for President Obama.
This new Russian strategy guarantees victory for the Syrian government-and makes Obama and U.S. look hopelessly bad. President in trouble!
"USERNAME: USERNAME You are a great American!! Thanks from a Vietnam vet!
The Russians are playing a very smart game. In the meantime they are buying lots of time for Syria and making U.S. look foolish. Dangerous!

Really bad news just announced concerning jobs. Far fewer jobs created in August than anticipated. Interest rates therefore to remain low.

That would mean that Eliot Spitzer has failed at everything he's done--politics TV & even real (cont) HYPERLINK
It will be interesting to see what happens to Eliot Spitzer if he loses the election for Comptroller to very capable USERNAME.

AGAIN TO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA - IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING!
"USERNAME: USERNAME have you seen the video of the rebel commander cutting out and eating the Syrian soldiers heart & liver!!
While everyone is waiting and prepared for us to attack Syria maybe we should knock the hell out of Iran and their nuclear capabilities?
If you look at the horrible picture on the front page of the NY Times of the "rebels" executing prisoners you would say forget the rebels!
Tell Congress to straighten out the many problems of our country before trying to be the policemen to the world. Make America great again!
"USERNAME: USERNAME god your the best Mr. Trump!"  I like you tooooo!
"USERNAME: USERNAME haha I love how you just tell like it is! You aren't who you are by not doing just that!" Thank you!
The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement. Do NOT attack Syriafix U.S.A.
President Obama put himself in a very bad position when he talked about Syria crossing the RED LINE. Amazingly now he denies he said that!
"USERNAME: USERNAME haha I love how you just tell like it is! You aren't who you are by not doing just that!"
"USERNAME: USERNAME you would make such a good president" Thank you!
"USERNAME: USERNAME hell yeah! Dammit I love the frankness and brutal honesty of USERNAME !" It is the only way!

Jay Leno and his people are constantly calling me to go on his show. My answer is always no because his show sucks. They love my ratings!
"USERNAME: "I wish I could go on Jay's show so badly!" Real quote from USERNAME" Real quote is "I wish they would stop calling"
USERNAME  Send it to me in New York Doug!  Thanks.
"USERNAME: USERNAME u mad because USERNAME doesn't want u on his show? He begs me to go on his show-done it many times loser!
"USERNAME: USERNAME " just turned off Jay!  I can't watch him anymore running out with the phony high fives-he's lost it!

"USERNAME: USERNAME you realize that is what Iran wants dont you?" You beat Iran in a much different fashion-not through Syria!
For all of those fools that want to attack Syria the U.S.has lost the vital element of surprise-so stupid-could be a disaster!
What I am saying is stay out of Syria.
The great GENERALS MacArthur and Patton real leaders and fighters are spinning in their graves as we give Syria info & time to prepare.

"USERNAME: USERNAME why the hell are you always criticising Obama"  Because he is doing a terrible in fact embarrassing job!
President Obama's "Arab Spring" is not looking so good right now!
"USERNAME: If the government just listened to USERNAME this country would be so much better!"
"USERNAME: USERNAME But if we had a Republican President you would say the exact opposite right?"  Wrong!
Think of it the Arab League doesn't want to get involved with Syria - but they want us to do their dirty work. How stupid!
If the U.S. attacks Syria and hits the wrong targets killing civilians there will be worldwide hell to pay. Stay away and fix broken U.S.
Our country is looking very bad right now!

In war the elememt of surprise is sooooo important.What the hell is Obama doing.
"USERNAME: USERNAME That's the plan. Have you ever seen such a clueless leader in all your life? I am stunned daily."
"USERNAME: USERNAME you should be our next President. This country would be in much better shape if you would have run in 2012!"True
"USERNAME: Why isn't USERNAME president instead of Obama ??"  That is truly a good question!
We have given Syria so much time and information-there has never been such an instance in wartime history. Syria is now fully prepared!
Why isn't the Arab League paying for everything and sending troops? They want us to do their dirty work with no involvement by themselves!
The Arab League stated that it wants nothing to do with an attack on Syria but they want us to attack.Are our leaders insane or just stupid
"USERNAME: USERNAME Any chance you'll change your mind and run for President? #GotMyVote"  Time will tell!
"USERNAME: USERNAME " How would you treat the Syria situation if president ?" I'd let them all fight with each other-focus on US!

"USERNAME: USERNAME Obviously amateur hour at the WH. Obama was unqualified when he ran and remains so."
"USERNAME: USERNAME he's no Churchill."   He might not even be Jimmy Carter!
"USERNAME: Just from reading his tweets it seems like USERNAME could run our country much better than our President right now.
Did anyone notice that Obama failed to get a coalition of other countries to go along with us. He couldn't even get Britain! NO LEADERSHIP.
USERNAME   Thank you.
"USERNAME: USERNAME can't say Obama doesn't know how to throw a polite war!"  General Patton would not be happy right now!
"USERNAME: USERNAME I'm scared for my future."  You should be!
Be prepared there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into World War III.
China is already preparing to benefit economically from this mess. They will pick up the pieces and make yet another fortune-& laugh at us!
Obama now just wants to save face Russia is now telling him "don't do it". He waited too long and the other side is much better prepared.
Who are our generals that are allowing this fiasco to happen right before our eyes. Call it the "PLENTY OF NOTICE WAR"
"USERNAME: USERNAME may be many things but one thing he is is right. #tellsitlikeitis" Thank you (sort of).
Syria has prepared for an attack based on all of our "talk" - they have moved targeted ammunition and supplies to new locations.Amazing!
For the first time in the history of military operations a country has broadcast what when and where they will be doing in a future attack!
The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria-big mistake if he does not!
"USERNAME: USERNAME if trump was POTUS we would have all the money we need! #trump 2016"   That's true!
"USERNAME: USERNAME the president of Syria is killing people inhumanly"  But the so called "rebels" may be just as bad (or worse)!
"USERNAME: USERNAME I usually agree with you not tonight. Stop criticizing The President."I will when he makes good decisions
"USERNAME: USERNAME USERNAME I would be totally surprised if the US even HAS any money to spend on Syria!!" We don't!
"USERNAME: USERNAME USERNAME We need a strong minded POTUS in office before we enter into another war."
"USERNAME: USERNAME what would you do - give a solution vs being so critical?.!."  I would make America great again!
"USERNAME: USERNAME for once the UK has seen sense and not been dragged into this." They were for once very smart!
"USERNAME: USERNAME he's to soft of a president"  Incompetent would be a better word!
"USERNAME: USERNAME Not to mention we probably don't have the money to spend on another long war!!"  So true!
How bad has our "leader" made us look on Syria. Stay out of Syria we don't have the leadership to win wars or even strategize.
If Obama attacks Syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed he and the U.S. will look very bad!
Is everyone seeing how incompetently our country is being run by watching the mess with Syria? Our leaders don't know what they are doing!
The ratings of The Cycle on MSNBC a sad and pathetic show are way down. If they fired racist moron USERNAME a truly stupid guy they live!

Let the Arab League take care of Syria. Why are these rich Arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack?
If we are going to continue to be stupid and go into Syria (watch Russia) as they say in the movies SHOOT FIRST AND TALK LATER!
I wonder what the great generals like Patton the big M or Robert E. LEE would have thought about our stupid broadcasting of an attack?
USERNAME   No dopey I would not go into Syria but if I did it would be by surprise and not blurted all over the media like fools.
"USERNAME: USERNAME the one who talks much does nothing" Except make 10 billion dollars - go get a job dumbass!
"USERNAME: USERNAME "USERNAME: Why Obama is giving up the element of surprise in Syria" Perhaps because he is stupid?
"USERNAME: USERNAME USERNAME a few billion more dollars but I'd rather say " President Trump" than" President Gates"!
That said the rich Arab countries should get involved with the Syrian mess not us.We should start rebuilding our own country & military.
Why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack Syria. Why can't we just be quiet and if we attack at all catch them by surprise?
I give the President's speech a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10! Not bad but room for improvement!
Why would anyone think Obama would attack Syria the day of his speech in Washington. He doesn't want to detract from his press & glory.

How can an Attorney General ask for campaign contributions during his evaluation of a case - a total sleazebag!

USERNAME Mark Cuban is a bully who is physically very soft and therefore should immediately stop wearing T shirts. No strength!
USERNAME can't hold a.candle to Donald.Trump - he is a laughing stock in Great Britain (but his show pays me lots of money so I'm happy)
The success of Shark Tank over the years is a total joke compared to the success of The Apprentice one of the biggest hits in T.V. history.
USERNAME   But I love insulting people who don't have the goods but think they do!
The Apprentice on the other hand has been a MAJOR television hit often times finishing #1. Even now after 13 seasons it wins its slot!

"USERNAME: Why are you giving away money this am USERNAME ?"  Because so many people need help!
"USERNAME: USERNAME what do you think of USERNAME?"   I don't think of Bill Maher - and nobody else does either.

George Ross and I have done some great real estate deals together. He‚Äôs a tough negotiator. #CelebApprentice
Looking forward to USERNAME's book of "Buseyisms"!
Romance or Adventure- what do you prefer? #CelebApprentice
For you newcomers George Ross was one of my first advisors on the original Apprentice. #CelebApprentice
‚ÄúGeorge has a real twinkle about him‚Äù says USERNAME. Really? The shark should be scared. #CelebApprentice
This assignment has been a challenge to both teams. #CelebApprentice
This assignment has stretched not just the imaginations but the patience quotas of USERNAME and USERNAME. #CelebApprentice
George Ross could be right‚ÄîUSERNAME would be better in the adventure task than the romance task. #CelebApprentice
.USERNAME isn‚Äôt excited about their ideas. Are you? #CelebApprentice
.USERNAME is making no attempt to help. Is he in BuseyLand? Their team is short on help already‚Ä¶ #CelebApprentice
How stressed are USERNAME and USERNAME already? #CelebApprentice
I hope you are watching the Apprentice...tonight's show is great and Brett Michaels is back!

Seems like the teams are surprised when USERNAME comes back. #CelebApprentice
What do you think of water boarding the Boston killer sometime prior to allowing our doctors to make him well? I suspect he may talk!
Make the Boston killer talk before our doctors make him better. Once he is well he will say "speak to my lawyers."
Don't forget to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9pm...you will love it!
I don't know how Al Michaels could have been drunk and arrested on Friday night if he was totally sharp on Saturday morning.
If the Boston killer applies for Obama Care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand!
NO MERCY TO TERRORISTS you dumb bastards!
Can you imagine the Boston killer being lovingly tended to in a hospital room right next to his victims who lost their arms legs and worse!
Bullshit-Pop gave me knowledge and a relatively small amount of money (split between brothers and sisters) and I built it into over 9 bill.
"USERNAME: USERNAME just a playboy
USERNAME  Tell me what were they doing in the Park playing checkers?

"USERNAME: USERNAME do you try to make everything about you?"  YES!
USERNAME   Great!
You are right the media is always offending Donald Trump-they have no limits-but they will do anything not to offend the Boston killer!
I know some of you may think l'm tough and harsh but actually I'm a very compassionate person (with a very high IQ) with strong common sense
Didn't the Boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away?  We are not dealing with an innocent baby here-DEATH
When the stupid people start feeling sorry for the Boston killer and want to release him and give him medals remember the killings-maimings
I hate when the news media so afraid to offend anyone always refers to the BOSTON KILLER as "the suspect".
The shirts and ties at Macy's are so good-beautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piece-l kicked his ass
I just won a big Court decision (N.Y. Post) against some character who claimed I owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties.
Oh no they are worried that they didn't read the Boston killer his rights and he may have a good legal argument. 12 year case to finish?  t
"USERNAME: USERNAME how do u feel about Marco Rubio?"  Drinks too much water!
"USERNAME: USERNAME Mr. Trump? How can people hate such a brilliant person?"  It is hard to believe isn't it! (Thanks).

"USERNAME: USERNAME in my opinion you are the best human being ever!" I like that better-thank you!
"USERNAME: USERNAME You are quite literally the worst human being ever." Thank you!
Is the Boston killer eligible for Obama Care to bring him back to health?
Read my tweets you dopes-of course he should get a trial-but fast (not a 12 year disaster).
You must be kidding-zero chance he is innocent!

Haters stop saying I went bankrupt it is not so. I never went bankrupt...
... but like many other great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage.
For the haters out of hundreds of deals or transactions I have used the bankruptcy laws 4 times in order to cut better deals.
Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool...
... Icahn Kravis Apollo and most others--but nobody says they went bankrupt!
People buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals...
... It is very effective and a commonly used business tool.

Re my hair-Should I change it? What do you think?
It's true... Dennis is really into this-very animated. I have never seen him this way before.
Which team is your favorite?
Re Omarosa: Nasty tough or smart...or all?
Does anyone agree with Marilu that Gary while 'adorable' is a distraction?
Omarosa is very confident that the execs loved her concept & presentation.
Next she says she's being set up by Omarosa to fail....is somebody confused?
What?!  LaToya is saying Omarosa is one of the nicest people she's met?
On the whole the teams seem to be working well together. No wars...yet.
Gary as the Cat in the Hat? He can work it out.

Trace delivers check to hospital in NYC:  American Red Cross must be grateful to Trace and his team for their tremendous work.
Honest Omarosa: she won't backstab-she'll come at you from the front.
Which team do you think has the edge in this interactive photo experience task assignment?
My 757 is incredible-I think the teams agree on that.
Will Team Power be able to withstand Omarosa as PM? Smooth sailing is not expected.
Will Plan B miss Trace?
Firing Bret was a tough one for me-but Omarosa doesn't seem to mind.
Omarosa always promises and delivers high drama...
Trace and his team raised an amazing amount of $.  Looks like a good season for charities.
There's definitely no love lost between Piers and Omarosa.

An individual whose whole career is trying to take down successful celebrities with nonsense campaigns has turned his attention to me.....

The media is so in the tank for Obama that it is amazing‚Äîthe funny thing is he can‚Äôt stand them!

IMO--- Manti Te‚Äôo was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the Heisman Trophy.
Can it just be new age that Manti Te‚Äôo fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax?
Not believable that Manti Te‚Äôo was in love for one year with a girl he never met- she then died. He is either very stupid....

I have decided to add a caveat to my offer. Obama can't decide to send my $5M to Rev. Wright if he releases his records.
My fellow Tea Party friends in Ohio--make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can GOTV election day. Know you can! Must win Ohio.
Where's the transparency? Despite Obama's denial USERNAME stands by report he just talked with Jeremiah Wright.
Looking forward to being the special guest at tonight's Dutchess County #GOP dinner--to a SOLD OUT crowd. It will be great fun.
Pretty audacious for Obama to call USERNAME a BSer when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write.
By the way where is USERNAME? Good question. 4 years ago she strongly supported Obama--now she is silent. Anyway who cares I adore Oprah.
...Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.
Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. The Middle East is a mess. Yet Colin Powell still endorses him. Wonder why?
Be careful of an Obama "bomb" to win election! Would be a horrible thing to do.
The election is still close but trending toward USERNAME. He leads all national polls and Obama's likeability is imploding. VOTE!

USERNAME Thanks Tylar
The Letterman show really turned things around- people finally understand my $5 million dollar offer to charity.... HYPERLINK
USERNAME I love the Wounded Warriors--Obama should choose that as his $5M charity.
USERNAME Sounds like a good idea.
USERNAME  Only because he has something to hide.
.USERNAME  Re: Taylor and Conor--great news for Taylor!
Based on the ovation last night from the Letterman USERNAME audience I believe it will be hard for Obama to throw $5M down the drain....
....instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause.
Another great charity that the $5M could go to just a recommendation to the Pres. - the Wounded Warriors represented so well by USERNAME
Lots of response that Obama should give the $5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi.
Letterman USERNAME was great last night. I had a lot of fun. You could see his audience really wanted Obama to take the $ for charity.
"The dealmaker is cunning secretive focused and never settles for less than he wants." --The America We Deserve
It is really a shame that Barack Obama may stop $5M from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent.
Doing David Letterman USERNAME tonight at 11:30. 1st nite of Sweeps.Going into the lion's den but I've been there many times before. Enjoy
Six days and counting until my offer to Barack Obama expires...
For someone who demanded 20 years of Mitt's tax returns you would think my offer to donate $5M to charity for his records is an easy go.
Yesterday Barack Obama said he wants "wind turbines manufactured here in China" HYPERLINK I don't think this was a gaffe.

.USERNAME shouldn‚Äôt be too upset over USERNAME.  He will always do great!
I am offering the chance for Barack Obama to redistribute $5M to any charity of his choice.  Everyone wins.  Take the deal.

In light the Benghazi emails released last night it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public...
... By releasing his records he can come clean with the American people and have $5 million go to a charity.
Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets.  Why can't he release his records?  Especially when $5M is going to charity.
I am happy to donate $5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses.  All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American people
RT USERNAME:Trump to Obama: $5 million donation to charity if you release passport and college records HYPERLINK #Election2012

Third rate USERNAME took every negative tweet or response they could find & put it out--when in fact the response is incredibly positive.
My offer to Obama is about transparency. In 2008 American people were sold on hope and change. This our last chance to get the full record.

Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert & Kristen.I don't have time except to say "Robert drop her she cheated on you & will again!"
Last night was the first time Obama said "we" instead of "I" in respect to Bin Laden's killing.
Barack Obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden--- now he wants all of the credit!
My announcement is tomorrow!
Tomorrow I will be tweeting on only one subject!
China will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own!

70% of the Chinese say they are better off than they were 4 years ago HYPERLINK  At least someone has done well under Obama.
The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama's failed foreign policy-- and I mean much more.
Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night. Viewership will be way down.

Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate

Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight. Always treated me fairly.
Well this is it the final debate- let's see how it goes. I'll be tweeting live.
Former Obama White House economic adviser USERNAME gave his old boss a 'C' on the economy HYPERLINK  Pretty generous!
Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K.
I look forward to USERNAME hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi. CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs.
Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama---just wait and see!
Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years he will thank me. Be smart Robert.
Obama is an easy target on foreign policy.USERNAME has many openings to attack especially when Obama starts bragging about Bin Laden.
"This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility." Obama to USERNAME discussing our nuclear arsenal.
Obama planted that USERNAME story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate. He wants Libya and China off the table.

Obama is planning on attacking Romney on Bain in tomorrow's debate HYPERLINK  Mitt should bring up college applications & records
"Romney Ryan Slam Obama Administration on China Currency Manipulation" HYPERLINK via USERNAME
Once again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator. He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us.
A-Rod should donate his contract to charity. He doesn't make the USERNAME any money and he doesn't perform. He is a $30M/yr rip off.
Looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for USERNAME supporters at the Intrepid. Mitt's doing well.
Barack Obama is not who you think he is. Most overrated politician in US history.
Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications? Boy would that create a mess! He is not who you think.
Lots of response to my comment on Diet Coke-¬†let's face it it doesn't work- just makes you hungry.
A-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue--- even though he was on the juice!
Derek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma?
I love USERNAME--such great people!
A-Rod is just not making it. We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great.
Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing.
Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks!
.USERNAME's poll numbers are looking really good. One more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout.¬†
I have never seen a thin person drinking  Diet Coke.
No I wasn't at the USERNAME game yesterday- can't go today either. When I go they win.
Brooklyn Nets have the worst uniform ever- Boring- won't matter if they win("Winning solves all problems"- (cont) HYPERLINK
Yankees can win today. Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher.
A-Rod hit ball hard first at bat. Time for him to step up and leave.
Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night.
.USERNAME are in trouble without Derek. Try A-Rod at short- get him some confidence.
A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter--- he is a great champion.
So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg- they deserved to lose.
Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away. Scrape and paint before too late.
Tonight despite everything put A-Rod in the lineup.¬†
Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod. Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason.¬†
They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer.
Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series.
I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win.
Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve-- they would have won.
When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say " what were we doing".
I told you whenever I go to a USERNAME game the USERNAME win.
"Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality." -- Warren G. Bennis
When an employee leaves me and begs to come back--I never let them. Loyalty is very important.

Very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate.
"What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy." --USERNAME
Obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families. The price of corn alone has risen over 200% since he was elected.

Great to hear that our loyal USERNAME fans are happy with today's announcement of the new cast. This will be something special!
.USERNAME looks like he really cleaned up his act.
I'm going to the USERNAME game tonight to root them on--they always win when I am there.
My Scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the world--a great honor for me.
Credibility is important to me- hence must admit that both candidates did really well last night. #VPDebate

ObamaCare is a complete disaster. Many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it. Terrible.
"Wing bangers"-- the name given to wind turbines by bird lovers for the thousands of birds they kill in the U.S.
British PM Cameron is making a fool of himself by wasting billions of pounds on unwanted & environment destroying Scottish windmills.
Going over to USERNAME now to introduce USERNAME cast etc.-- watch.
Pretty even debate- no knockouts. However Ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger. What do you think? #VPDebate
Biden's statements on Medicare are very effective. Ryan must now come back and combat. #VPDebate
Excellent story on USERNAME- very good moment for Ryan. #VPDebate
Biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching. #VPDebate
Hard for Biden to justify Libya mess but doing best he can. #VPDebate
Both candidates are looking sharp- now it's up to the mouth and the mind. #VPDebate

Why does Barack Obama's ring have an arabic inscription? HYPERLINK Who is this guy?
It's Thursday and only 26 days until the election. How many illegal donations from China and Saudi Arabia did Obama collect today?
So Obama used to tell classmates that he was Kenyan royalty and an Indonesian prince HYPERLINK  Sounds like his book bio!
Our foreign policy decisions are dumbest in U.S. history
Live tweeting during tonight's VP debate...should be a great time
How the hell does the Libyan government get off telling our embassy security they can't have loaded guns for protection?!
Why the hell did we help the Libyan "rebels" in the first place. That is the real scandal.
Outright disgusting--the Obama administration has continually stonewalled and lied to US Amb. Sean Smith's mother HYPERLINK
I suspect USERNAME could do well tonight. Don't be fooled by his gaffes. He is a seasoned and feisty debater.
If USERNAME is dating USERNAME again then she has a death wish. A beater is always a beater--just watch!
Amazing that Derek Jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's USERNAME game and did so well.
$30M a year and A-Rod is now relegated to the bench. USERNAME would have lost if Girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th (see my prediction)
I guess they have Lance Armstrong cold. Brutal report. A waste of taxpayer money to take down an American hero.
.USERNAME cast will be announced tomorrow at 7:30am ET on the USERNAME with USERNAME
Staff at Trump Park Avenue disliked A-Rod--to put it "mildly" -- The staff at Trump World Tower loves Derek Jeter.
Asking why my dislike of A-Rod--dishonorable dealings with me on an apartment deal
Great move to take A-Rod out of game. Now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation (drugs).
"When everything seems to be going against you remember that the airplane takes off against the wind not with it." -- Henry Ford

I am more concerned about Biden in the debate than I am about Obama. Be careful on Thursday night!
"You have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving Big Bird."  -- USERNAME
Consumer spending fell in September HYPERLINK  Another indicator the 7.8% unemployment number is cooked.
A-Rod must be dropped in the Yankees line-up tonight if they want to win. He simply can't perform without drugs.
Obama was guest at VP debate moderator Martha Raddatz's wedding HYPERLINK  Do people think this is fair?
Receiving thousands of thank you letters from USERNAME students for my convocation speech. The honor was all mine!  Great people.
DELUSIONAL--Obama actually thought that he won the debate HYPERLINK What is he thinking?
47M on food stamps. Over 23M Americans unemployed. 50% of college grads unemployed. And Obama wants us talking about Big Bird.
Has Barack Obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations? Media?
I just had to fire someone he didn't have a clue--he reminded me of Obama on Wednesday night.
27 days until America's greatest test since our founding. In this election we decide whether we become great again.
"It doesn't matter who you vote for--it matters who is counting the votes." Be careful of voter fraud!
Obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate. Let's see how he reacts under pressure.
Remember Obama limped across the finish line--he should have lost to Hillary. Be careful!
I don't think Obama will do well in the second debate--he is psyched out just like A-Rod.
"I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. On this there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin." -- Mitt
